One of the most emotion-filled songs i‚Äôve ever heard,@rydogjkjr3325,2025-02-25T02:51:06Z,1760
"This sounds so good. Live players, analog synths, real emotion. Fantastic. Finally pop that isn't killing my ears with harshness.",@benjaminmiller9656,2025-05-26T10:05:08Z,344
"I found this randomly not knowing anything about Chappell and halfway through I realized, ""Wait, she's singing about another girl being disingenuous about her feelings for her and living with regret."" I thought the lyrics were incredibly clever, and as a straight guy dealing with the devastating effects of ending a situationship where she couldn't commit, but had strong feelings, this song encapsulates how this girl's life will turn out. She wrote this about her own experiences, but I'm devastated and this song brings such relief.",@michaelmacbeth7171,2024-12-05T07:03:26Z,241

"This song goes on my Mount Rushmore of pop songs. I've been playing it on repeat for months now, can't stop listening to it. It's so deep, so many layers, yet so catchy and such a bop. I listen to it and cry and I'm not even gay...everyone can relate to the feeling of unrequited love. It's just so beautiful.",@Kellygluckman,2025-01-14T23:37:00Z,11
I usually don't care for modern music. I know it sounds pretencious and all that yeah yeah. But I fucking love Chapelle Roan and her music. Girl knows how to sing and the mix of modern musical tropes and the eighties synth vibes to almost all her songs absolutely fucks. Also helps that she is a goddamn gay icon at this point and I hope she continues her rise. Good shit good shit.,@astaroththedaeva9717,2025-02-25T04:48:51Z,10

The emotion in the vocals and simplicity of the hook said it all before I read the lyrics. Too many ladies that need love and respect. I had to choose one.

"It's a good song, but looking at the lyrics as a story, it's possible the lover really is a closeted lesbian. But it's more likely that, the character Chappell is portraying is lacking self-awareness. The _contempt_ with which she says 'nothing but a wife' shows how she doesn't respect heterosexual relationships and that they can be loving too. So I think she's using her own lack of understanding/empathy towards straight couples to turn this into an 'us vs them' thing. Maybe her ex left her simply because of Chappell's personality, and she doesn't want to face that. So she blames straightness instead. 'You didn't leave me because I'm shallow; it's because you're in denial.' Seems implausible.",@AlexReynard,2025-02-11T21:38:57Z,3

With that song along you've touched so many people. I thank God for your disappointments in all your relationships. Because you've helped others through your experience.

"Hate this song so much. We all know an emotional manipulator like the main character of this song. ""I want to be me. Is that not aloud?"" OK, gaslighting?? I'm sorry you smoke like a chimney and I care about your health enough to ask you to stop. You get so high you don't even clean your room. I'm sorry I don't want you to be a slob, bro. I know you're impatient, so I should know better than to keep you waiting? And then I try to explain, but you tell me to shut up for once in my life? Lol bro, OP is a terrible person to have as a friend, family member or a lover. I say get a job and then ask you where you've been? Nobody that actually needs you to get a job would wonder where you've been. We would assume you're at work helping like we asked. OP is a master manipulator",@merkuryretrograde8835,2025-04-22T20:31:22Z,0
"I changed the lyrics for my cheating husband you can kiss a hundred girls in bars and when you wake up next to her in the middle of the night youre nothing more than her husband. He wont leave her or me, so i play this song around him just to taunt him and he hates it. Eventually, he WILL have to stop the world to stop the feeling. üò¢ I love you, Chappell. Youve helped me and im sure numerous others with their self worth. I know it now, and i wont let anyone hold me down for their own selfish reasons. GOOD LUCK, BABE!",@sarahmccollum3694,2025-02-06T18:01:12Z,0

You dont have to stop the  world to stop a feeling .  U gonna let an emotion get you life that gurl ?  I was in LOVE / LUST with somebody that was so so so  bad for me .

Not too sure about the popularity of this song...starts off with the intro and body sounding like Leon and than the chorus sounds like what Marina and the Diamonds does in her sleep...good but lack originality,@kieranng1172,2025-03-31T15:18:43Z,0

I love this song so much such a Kate Bush 80s type of vibe. I wish the song itself would‚Äôve won a Grammy but nonetheless I‚Äôm glad Chappell won for favorite new artist. But every year there‚Äôs a new artist. But this song was on repeat for me all of 2024 along with short n sweet album,@JasonHodges-w5r,2025-02-03T06:06:46Z,0
