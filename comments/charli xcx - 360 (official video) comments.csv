"Not to maaajorly over-analyze, but that model expression is so unique to me. It gives the vibe that she's breaking the 4th wall, aware of the chaos around her, and still acting like she's currently posing for a magazine. It feels like she's still there as a full human person, like we're almost there, and she's not being just an idea or concept or character, she's human but still tapping into a boss part of herself. I think it's unique because most modelly expressions look detached and/or beyond their current situation and tend not to be grounded. I especially love it with the wine chaos going on - she's blinking wildly but she's still slaying. She keeps looking like she's battling the elements, even when there aren't elements to fight, and it's just so cool. Video modelling fr",@katara9,2024-07-18T15:05:18Z,7

Her voice is magical. Ever since Boom Clap I've just felt that her voice carries this energy. It's almost like even when she's belting out lyrics she's taking a bracing breath in as if she were about to jump off a high dive or something. That doesn't really make sense but it's the best way I can describe her voice.
