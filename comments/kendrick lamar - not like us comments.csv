"I am a 59 year old woman and when I tell u that Kendrick has me turning this up EVERY SINGLE time. Dont know why it resonated with me waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy before I knew there was a beef. I just loved the beat and lyrics. But baebeeeeeeeeee, the SuperBowl performance had me with such great pride!!!!! As one of soldiers on the frontline of the movement from 60's to now, I must say I was so impressed and loved it. It got me into the rest of his music. Im highly impressed and proud of K-Dot. For the first time I feel like this young man brought generations together. Me my kids, grandkids and great grand vibe out to this anthem. Yes I SAID ANTHEM !!! Also with wats going on in our nation in 2025, baby we need this and so much more!!! I know I can speak for our nation when I say. THEY NOT LIKE US!!!!",@deevamartin7413,2025-03-22T23:29:08Z,98

"I've been listening to Kendrick since he was K. Dot. (After listening to ""Spiteful Chant"" & ""A.D.H.D"" I knew he was gonna blow up)I have no idea why Drake thought beefing with one of the best Lyricists ever and one of the few that was able to go MAINSTREAM without selling out would b a good idea. Who else would make a beef song the biggest hit of the year AND play it at the Superbowl with drakes ex serena. Even when Drake was at his best he still would have gotten completely destroyed.

"It seems like im the only one who thinks song is whack as hell. Nothing like the Tupac, Nas, the lox, DMX,Jayz, Queens bridge, Rocafella, Eminem, D12, 50 cent , G-Unit diss tracks . It’s so confusing. Drake , lil Wayne era songs were so much better no ? I admit I may be missing something but why did this song get so much clout ? Seems like it was because a rapper went after another rapper and the generation never was alive to witness a rap beef. That was the regular back in the day and it ranks at the bottom as one of the worst diss tracks I ever heard in my life and I’ve heard them all.

"I have to know what a 3:35 a 69 god is? A pervert devil/sex god worshipper?. If so you can add Celine Dion to that list. The publicity campaign for the children's clothing line she did a few years ago is disturbing. And he is just kicking back chill because he's one of fewer and fewer people with their eyes actually open. He sparked some creative energy in me. Don't just sit by and assume anyone else is going to save the world, you have to do your part and then we'll have hope. That's a call to action. I'm working on a bill to submit to congress focused on not overwhelm the system by taking 86% of children away from the family for drug addiction, then turn around and drug all of those children and put them in homes where they are raped and beaten while the kids who are suffering physical abuse are often looked over or given back. I know all too well. I was exposed to sexual explicit hand made dolls @DFS interview at the principal office at school. They looked like cloth African American cabbage patch dolls will adult parts and they isolated me and showed them to me trying to get me to say something had happened to me. There's only one black student in my entire school DISTRICT! So why not regular dolls? It's a super disturbing moment from my life. And I was kidnapped from school in Kindergarten!

"Also…having an American artist go onto the Super Bowl stage…the world stage…the BIGGEST world stage and; a. Make an unfounded accusation of a fellow artist being a C3PDOH and B. To use this world stage to so heavily promote so much gang culture/Crip/Crip walking/Pro-gang material is genuinely beyond irresponsible. It’s a rap beef & one of the best/most savage/entertaining/hard fought in hip-hop/rap history, it deserves every accolade within its particular genre that’s available, but to have this disrespectful, pro-gang culture, otherworldly disrespectful track repeat blasted into every television across the world that tuned in to watch my Birds beat KC into a bloody slurry…that’s just wrong…and on every level. Keep that shit where it belongs…and where it belongs is not on the front page-representing our entire country to the world in such a… “manner”. No one has to agree with me, but that doesn’t change the fact that what I’m saying is true. We need to stop promoting this gang worship that’s been going on, too many young kids are watching this shit, taking up a flag and dyin in the streets across the country & now the world over this fake ass culture that in & of itself manages to be hypocritical of itself in representing the culture as being the result of systemic oppression while simultaneously glorifying the life style of its OWN accord and inspiring millions of youth to emulate what they are seeing.

"Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte, just delivered the bomb. Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen-footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. Heh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. Y'know, it's... kinda like ol' squares in a battle like, uh, you see in a calendar, like the Battle of Waterloo, and the idea was, shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin', and sometimes the shark'd go away... sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into ya. Right into your eyes. Y'know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites ya. And those black eyes roll over white, and then... oh, then you hear that terrible high-pitch screamin', the ocean turns red, in spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in and they rip you to pieces. Cage goes in the water? You go in the water. Shark is in the water. Our shark. Y'know, by the end of that first dawn... lost a hundred men. I dunno how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I dunno how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland- baseball player, boatswain's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... bobbed up and down in the water just like a kinda top. Upended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. Young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. Y'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest. Anyway... we delivered the bomb.",@yourrtrustyreviewer1692,2025-06-21T19:00:15Z,0
