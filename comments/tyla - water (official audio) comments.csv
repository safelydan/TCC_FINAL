Western music sung by an African. The only thing African about this song is the Amapiano beat.,@slimthickaz.,2023-09-18T23:41:50Z,0
(Sigh) ..I came here because I read that her music had elements of Afrobeat in it... there isn't any here. It's just an African version of the typical style in songs we hear in America...so boring.,@JohnnieJames1964,2025-05-06T02:24:36Z,0

"Love this. Just sounds a lil off when the hooks drop after the verses. It seems like the verses and chorus were created at different times 🤷🏽‍♂️ like, sonically it all sounds amazing obviously. ALL the vocals. It’s just when the hook drops it come in a bar after when it would traditionally drop. If the producers meant to do that then that’s an artistic choice and das cool but if the mixing engineer didn’t align everything properly idk 🤷🏽‍♂️ - this is just me being a engineer 👨🏾‍💻 don’t mind - an amazing song either way",@MichaelRafael,2023-09-23T14:11:45Z,0
