"I do not care for country, nor do I care for these nasty comments. But because I grew up around country, I know when I hear a catchy country tune. I love this… it may not be your normal to the others, but I am very appreciative of your flexibility with music, it gives me a new perspective.  This is a beautiful piece that you sang your heart out to, and I feel like more people should appreciate it for just what it is. 🔥💚🔥",@sowapuss1174,2025-03-02T01:55:53Z,24

Beyonce is absolutely stunning here. The songs a great catchy pop choon.,@MrJaimilly,2024-12-26T00:49:14Z,7
"I’ve never been a fan of Beyoncé, but this song can easily get lost in your head, and you can’t shake it. Besides that, I do have to say this.  Experimenting with different genres can help, until you find your voice, all new singers that break out into the music scene do this.  But for Beyoncé who’s been doing R&B, pop and hip hop music for as long as she has to jump ship to country is a big leap. Her voice is a powerhouse in the other genres of music and that’s been her vibe for all of her musical life. It’s great she’s expanding her repertoire and trying her hand at Country, and  Country musicians welcomed her with open arms to the country music  family.  But with her vocals mixing with country music is an absolute long shot. I admit country music isn’t what it used to be, it’s a little more poppy, but there some artist’s that love to go back to the traditional ways of what country music use to be. But in the case of Miss Beyoncé, there are already Country Queens. I’d rather her be in the zone where she has been labeled a queen in her more recognized career.",@ashleye.3131,2024-11-04T10:32:58Z,6

I have a hot dance routine for Bodyguard. I loved being on an emotional roller coaster while listening to this masterpiece. Some of my favorite songs include Levi jeans, Protector, Riverdance, Yaya, Tyrant II Most Wanted, Bodyguard, Blackbird, 16 carriages, and Texas Hold 'Em, not to mention spaghetti.

I don't care how much backlash I get but you can't make a country song with cuss words in it. Sorry Beyonce but that's not how country rolls. Also this in my opinion is worst song I ever heard from her. No hate just stay in your lane (btw the way before you say this is racist im black)  I like country the way is no cussing. You can't call it a country song if there's cussing in it. If you look at all the country songs there's not one cuss word in them. Stay with the hip hop genre.,@Oboroshirakumo342,2025-03-06T19:38:21Z,3

Beyonce sings like a pop artist, even in this and her lyrics are dull because she can not sing country.. She did not put much effort in to adding the quirks that country singers are doing to make their songs sound like country. Beyonce won because she is famous and are in a good position with the once who decide who will win or not. It is dumb how famous artists just ride the wave once they get famous and get praised for mediocre stuff.

"So, if I replace the 64's in my raps song for a horse and slip a guitar in with twang in it, I could be country, too?😅🤣😂 She's country like Tracy Adkins is. This has nothing to do with her race either. Black people are the OG cowboys if you don't know. It's just super hard to believe that SHE is in any way country. The big city life Diva over sang in all her old Hip Hop and R&B cuts and now she is over singing in country, too. Whatever. But, how much support would Alan Jackson get if his next album was Gansta Rap? You tell me. M.C. Hammer tried to switch from Gospel Rap to Gansta Rap and he got slaughtered for it. (M.C. Hammer is more gangsta than 99.9% of ""Gangsta Rappers"". For real.)That's in the same genre! Art Official Age as the late, great, greatest of all time, Price put it. (If you don't know, look it up.) There is a reason why Darius Rucker was able to cross over to country; he only had to slightly jump over a narrow gap. Beyonce has an ocean to cross to connect her old to new. But, that's only if you care about authenticity. If not, Beyonce is also the heaviest metal vocalist there has ever been. 🤘Hooray, Beyince!!!! You go , girl!!!",@tonycasaus3039,2025-08-09T16:46:48Z,0

This is a piss poor excuse for country wtf happened to the genre for this to win the grammy she's basically stills doing the same music just in a lower tone n to a slightly different style beat it's sad,@mummbles8319,2025-02-06T17:49:42Z,0

After listening to the song i can understand why many (other than the culture war grifters) do not really consider this song to be country. this sounds like slightly less generic mainstream pop which it essentially is to my ears.,@realKarlFranz,2024-10-09T17:35:23Z,0
