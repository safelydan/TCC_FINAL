"To my surprise, this song, unexpectedly, moved me deeply; a man nearing fifty, I found myself unexpectedly touched by its simple melody and heartfelt lyrics.",@samuelzhang777,2025-01-02T06:13:59Z,79
This goes deep into my heart.😢 Reminded me of my late father who passed away just 3 months ago after suffering from the horrible pancreatic cancer. Music heals and connecting me to him again spiritually.,@AC-kq6sp,2024-09-20T10:53:32Z,76
"Billie Eilish captures the intensity of devotion in 'Birds of a Feather,' turning love's fragility into something fiercely eternal. Her vocals are a beautiful reflection of the paradox of love both tender and unbreakable. The emotional weight behind this track feels like a whispered promise of forever, even in the face of inevitable goodbyes.",@LoversSymphony,2024-09-23T19:42:04Z,66
"Easily Song of the Year. First time I listened to it on the album, for me it was an instant classic. I was craving for a song like this: simple, passionate and mostly universal. Anyone can vibe, from Gen Z to Baby Boomers, reminding of their teenage love. I'm not a Billie Eilish fan, but I have to thank her for delivering what I wanted.",@org-prod,2024-09-21T01:50:32Z,34

"Every time I listen to this song, I feel an overwhelming love for myself, yet at the same time, a deep disappointment. It’s like I can see a version of me that has grown, changed, and become everything I want to be—but I’m still stuck in the same place. This song makes me reflect on that distant version of myself, almost like we exist in different lifetimes. It’s bittersweet, but also comforting. Thank you for creating something that speaks so deeply to emotions I struggle to put into words.",@sebuahlilin3462,2025-02-25T17:08:08Z,3

"Two years ago, I had to distance myself from the girl I wanted to share my life with forever. Sometimes I still remember her in the little things she left behind in my life — especially in the music we used to listen to. She used to play “I Don’t Wanna Be You Anymore” every time we were together. This is the first time I’ve listened to the song all the way through; I’m sure it would’ve been one of our favorites. Hearing the opening melody always brings her to my mind, and for a long time, it used to make me tremble. Today, I missed her a lot — but something was different. I hope she’s okay.",@luisdanielpinagarcia5334,2025-07-30T10:37:58Z,1

I'm a mess, I was desperate, and I became toxic. My actions may cause you doubt with how stressful it may seem. But do know my intentions were genuine. I'm too stupid to understand what you wanted. I was afraid- I'm always afraid of losing you. And like a cornered rat, I desperately did everything I know in order to keep you. Which made you further distance yourself. My heart still beats for you, and it aches at how far you distanced yourself. I don't know what to do anymore, so now I pray to your saint, Saint Juan. So please let him have a listen to my heart's genuine intentions.",@Bread-ty2ue,2024-09-30T12:24:24Z,0

I think my partner is going to break up with me soon and this song just triggers something in me that hurts me deeply. I don't know what I'll do without them,@nereasn5970,2024-10-10T03:50:39Z,0
"This composition follows a simple OGWT ""tin pan alley chord progression""  - Dmaj7.....Bm7......Em7 .......A7.....(or a 1 - 6 - 2 - 5 chord progression) which is why it's so catchy and hypnotic. Similarly, sometimes the alternative format of 6 - 2 - 5 - 1 has a similar melodic structure.",@lyndamcardle4123,2024-11-20T22:09:34Z,0

The lyrics to this song are SO convoluted. Switching from one end to the next. How chaotic. Exactly like a situationship and limerence. Get out of the limerence people.,@jadegreen1554,2025-06-30T15:42:43Z,0

I am quite late to the party but that song is unreal. Credit to Billie but mad respect to Finneas. This guy is a genuis. I mean they both are. Just watched that video how they made that song and the time and effort they poured into it. This song brings out all sort of emotions and memories - both good and bad ones.,@rudhi87,2024-10-12T06:47:31Z,0

"The truth is that I never liked her music. But Birth of a Feather, the musical composition, the lyrics and the great voice of this girl have defeated me. What a great talent. I fell in love with her.",@Angelgamesusa,2024-12-03T17:30:49Z,0

My friend and co-worker introduced me to the song and it's so beautiful reminds me of the 90s with a little bit of MGMT. Lyrics are beautiful,@isabellarubio9019,2024-09-25T16:30:04Z,0

This is such a beautiful song but I will say (and kill me if you want) but it does seem like the music overpowers the vocals at times.,@kaitlynbilliard6930,2025-01-19T16:19:39Z,0
