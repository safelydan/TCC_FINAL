Dua is incredible and I'm so glad that I'm not missing out on her talent because of my age.

Il dipinto dell'equinozio d'autunno, il preambolo del valzer giallo degli alberi della stagione, è uno scenario teatrale psicologico emotivo della composizione dei colori esposti sulla parete celeste; il grigio sincero si amalgama con la luce degli ultimi bagliori, nelle sfumature di tutti i perpetui del firmamento!!! La visione della sirena ebbe luogo sulla pietra azzurra del mare, e sotto la grande bocca della luna, che cantava nel diapason del mondo acquatico delle balene e dei delfini; catturare i sensi di marinai e pescatori; e svegliarsi  il sonno profondo degli scogli nell'infinito dei pensieri oceanici!!!
