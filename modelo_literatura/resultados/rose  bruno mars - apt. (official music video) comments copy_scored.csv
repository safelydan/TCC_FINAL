I do find this song interesting. And I have no idea what they are saying. I understand the English. Idk the other stuff I'm guessing it's a different language.  But I really don't vibe with this genre. Although  I love whatever that ran lango is. No actually the start of the song is what draws me in,@D34DW4T3R,2025-06-27T17:17:19Z,0,0.6187,Positive

"1:10-1:36 and 2:09-end are probably my favorite sections. Them singing together, layering, the drone notes underneath that rise with the chord progression and the ""ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah, ahhhhh"" behind that just really make this feel almost bittersweet? Like a graduation, where you're celebrating a new beginning but its still the end of something and you're going through old memories and laughing, crying, smiling. These parts of the song in particular just really connected to me.",@thecatladytm7172,2025-07-14T22:25:39Z,0,0.8445,Positive
