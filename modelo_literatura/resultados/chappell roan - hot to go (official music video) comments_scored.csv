80s synth pop. This was high school for me. She captures that era in which I think was the best in music history. 80-95 was sensational with sounds from all over the world,@heyjoejp,2025-02-04T11:21:37Z,1460,0.6369,Positive

"It's so deeply hard to love someone that you can't be with. Even as someone who isn't currently in a queer relationship, the longing is still there. It's hard when you know that someone loves you back, uou truly know, but they can't let themselves give in and be happy. For us, it isn't a matter of coming out but. There is so much love and longing. I've been with people who have said they wanted me, people that lied and with him. Its always been a different. When I'm with him, every love song makes sense. He makes me feel undeniably beautiful, like he never had a doubt. To have someone stop what they were doing to come across the table and kiss you... and you can see from the look it's because they just can't wait a second longer to kiss you. You know that there's more there than can even be said. And to not be with him. It's an aching pain that I'm not willing to let go of yet.",@wickeddeetz999,2025-02-14T03:00:18Z,1,0.9814,Positive

Could have been a song from any year 1980 to 1987. Which is a good thing. Funny how all the kids think this is new. I love it but she's '80's synth pop all the way. And not at all controversial. Madonna caused more of a stir than Gaga or Roan ever did. Keep it up though and maybe someone will start making good rock and country again from your inspiration.,@davep2945,2025-02-23T23:25:48Z,0,0.9417,Positive

"Growing up in a big city, i feel like i don't relate to a lot of the typical midwest high school experience, but one thing i sure do relate to is the football and cheerleader culture. I was in the school band, so i had to show up to games whether i wanted to or not, and usually i'd tried to find my friends in the stands or flirt with the football guys on the sidelines, but was easily spotted because we had to be in uniform. When all else failed i'd just mess with the drumline until they got fed up and beat me with their sticks and mallets. Unfortunately for them, my instrument was made from stainless steel and was bought second hand, already kinda broken, so i had zero qualms beating them back. Such times those were. Also loved to piss off the saxophones by playing careless whisper on the flute.",@Blitz-.-,2025-01-01T05:24:27Z,0,0.0489,Neutral

*sigh*…. There seems to be this trend where in the official music videos for songs there’s always a 30-60 second intro without music and it’s a shame because it really throws off the vibe of a playlist if you want to just “spam skip” the ads and just keep on jamming 3:,@BryceicleTheIcicle,2025-03-16T15:16:48Z,0,-0.4215,Negative

I don’t understand why people enjoy listening to lyrics like this someone please explain like I genuinely want to know because to me it’s just weird openly talking about sex especially in front of your grandparents. Talking about your sexuality is not what I’m saying that is healthy and good to do but talking about actual sex is just so odd to me,@Jewmama,2024-12-11T16:29:24Z,0,0.4335,Positive

The only reasons I knew this wasn’t 80’s when I first heard it was because I’d never heard it and the vocals sound a little more polished like a modern studio will do even though the effects are going for that retro sound. Funny how history tends to repeat itself with things like music and fashion. Not sure we’ll ever have the talent and depth of mainstream music like pre 80’s again given there’s no incentive to create such artistically deep music anymore as the modern audience doesn’t have the patience and wants the short instant payoff with everything but that fits well with 80’s style so here’s to hoping we can get more 80’s sounding music in the mainstream. I couldn’t care less what the lyrics are about.,@burtonupchurch1690,2025-02-23T21:15:46Z,0,0.9491,Positive
