"Love this. Just sounds a lil off when the hooks drop after the verses. It seems like the verses and chorus were created at different times 🤷🏽‍♂️ like, sonically it all sounds amazing obviously. ALL the vocals. It’s just when the hook drops it come in a bar after when it would traditionally drop. If the producers meant to do that then that’s an artistic choice and das cool but if the mixing engineer didn’t align everything properly idk 🤷🏽‍♂️ - this is just me being a engineer 👨🏾‍💻 don’t mind - an amazing song either way",@MichaelRafael,2023-09-23T14:11:45Z,0,0.9032,Positive
