"Die With A Smile: A Legacy of Joy This phrase, ""Die With A Smile,"" speaks volumes about approaching life's end with peace and acceptance. It's not about denying pain or hardship, but rather about cultivating a life where the positive memories and relationships outweigh the negativity. It encourages us to find joy in the present moment, cherish loved ones, and live a life aligned with our values, so that when the time comes, we can depart with a sense of contentment and a smile on our face. It's a reminder to live fully, love deeply, and leave a legacy of joy.",@ammarabrahem1151,2025-08-22T05:36:58Z,0,0.9932,Positive

"Hi Stephanie, I hope you don't mind me calling you that, I didn't come here to give you a suggestion or hire you to do a show, I came to do something better, I came to praise you and apologize to you, I was so stupid, I wish I had known your story before judging you, many may see this message as pity for what happened, but no, your story is inspiring, I started judging you because I saw everyone doing it, because I preferred to be manipulated by the opinion of others, but now I have formed my own opinion about you, and I wanted to say that I am a big fan of yours, I wanted to meet you in person, hug you and apologize in person, but as that day has not yet arrived, I hope you forgive me for everything, and I want you to know that I have huge thoughts for the future because of you, but one day you will find out what it is, I want you to know that I think you are beautiful, strong, determined and wonderful, I hope you forgive me for everything I said about you, and that I am very sorry for the bullying and rape you went through, a kiss until any day, year, whatever, bye 🤗🎉😍😚😊❤",@PatriciaMartinsReal,2025-07-22T17:49:58Z,0,0.9967,Positive

"JESUS CHRIST IS COMING VERY SOON,  He died for you, and wasting time on this earth ent worth it. Jesus is the answer to your pain, your sorrow, that heavy heart, he can fix your breathing problems, when you feel like you can't breathe properly, he can fix it. And mostly JESUS CHRIST is the only one who can full that emptiness in you, an emptiness that money, songs, food, and pleasure can not full, all these things are temporary. But JESUS, he would satisfy you unto eternity. I was lost in this world, and Jesus came to me. He can come to you too if you just repent and give your life sincerely to him, don't take it because JESUS wants it, and your life is worth living, if you just give it to him.",@jeliciafitzpatrick7171,2025-07-17T13:10:10Z,0,0.4567,Positive

"Recently, I had a dream of my sister, who passed away in November of 2024 . I watched her walk into a house where we had a gathering, and my mind was telling me how.  She couldn't be here knowing that she had passed already . And I immediately started to cry and she looked at me and told me everything was ok and not to cry .I was crying so hard that I woke myself up and I was still crying . Then, as I was leaving for work the this song played, and listening to the 1st verse hit me so hard.  I love you Lena , I miss you more than ever .
