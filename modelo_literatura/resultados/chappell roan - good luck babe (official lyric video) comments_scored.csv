"I found this randomly not knowing anything about Chappell and halfway through I realized, ""Wait, she's singing about another girl being disingenuous about her feelings for her and living with regret."" I thought the lyrics were incredibly clever, and as a straight guy dealing with the devastating effects of ending a situationship where she couldn't commit, but had strong feelings, this song encapsulates how this girl's life will turn out. She wrote this about her own experiences, but I'm devastated and this song brings such relief.",@michaelmacbeth7171,2024-12-05T07:03:26Z,241,0.1785,Positive,Positive

I usually don't care for modern music. I know it sounds pretencious and all that yeah yeah. But I fucking love Chapelle Roan and her music. Girl knows how to sing and the mix of modern musical tropes and the eighties synth vibes to almost all her songs absolutely fucks. Also helps that she is a goddamn gay icon at this point and I hope she continues her rise. Good shit good shit.,@astaroththedaeva9717,2025-02-25T04:48:51Z,10,0.5317,Positive,Positive

"It's a good song, but looking at the lyrics as a story, it's possible the lover really is a closeted lesbian. But it's more likely that, the character Chappell is portraying is lacking self-awareness. The _contempt_ with which she says 'nothing but a wife' shows how she doesn't respect heterosexual relationships and that they can be loving too. So I think she's using her own lack of understanding/empathy towards straight couples to turn this into an 'us vs them' thing. Maybe her ex left her simply because of Chappell's personality, and she doesn't want to face that. So she blames straightness instead. 'You didn't leave me because I'm shallow; it's because you're in denial.' Seems implausible.",@AlexReynard,2025-02-11T21:38:57Z,3,-0.1802,Negative,Positive

I know you're impatient, so I should know better than to keep you waiting? And then I try to explain, but you tell me to shut up for once in my life? Lol bro, OP is a terrible person to have as a friend, family member or a lover. I say get a job and then ask you where you've been?
