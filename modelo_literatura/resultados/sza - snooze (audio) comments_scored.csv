"I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.",@enchantedchat1237,2023-11-14T05:04:02Z,0,0.9993,Positive
