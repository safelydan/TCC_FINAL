"Happy 1st Anniversary. I can't believe it's been a year already, I remember when this said 1 hour ago. Spring and Summer 2024 was peak, but Summer 2023 was better. The summer vibe and chorus goes so hard, as a guy, I'm not too crazy with this song, but the vibe goes hard. 1 year since this went off the charts along with They Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar during Summer 2024. I'm already nostalgic for 2024, so much good happened. This year really sucks horribly with the plane crashes, the stock markets, everything, basically. I know I shouldn't be getting nostalgic for 2024, but that was my year getting out depression from Late Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, so I do miss 2022 - 2024 a lot. This year hasn't been hitting in this crazy country and world we live in. Too many bad things are happening! I wanna go back so bad!

"What made this song so interesting is not the lyrics, the lyrics are unrealistic nonsense that portrays an unreal world that does not exist, everyone ends up distancing themselves from a short woman who is a hassle, but what made this song cool is the relaxed mood it conveys, of a costly little girl who gets up to mischief with men, it has a hint of the negative aspect of Feminism that most of the time provides a tragic end for women who go around getting up to mischief with men and people, and it is a backward concept, in fact, nowadays people want good relationships of trust, the planet has evolved to the fifth dimension, Spirits that insist on the old world, which promotes injustice as Feminist laws defend, are being removed from the planet, in the Exile of Kiron, but anyway, what made the instrumental of this song cool, were the mixing and mastering resources, very well combined, and a great producer. who worked on mixing and mastering, turned a song with silly lyrics into a great song due to the resources used",@MIKEKeanuriveres,2025-06-28T10:49:00Z,2,0.95,Positive

That move looks so familiar. It's like she's paying homage to a famous dance break from another music video or drag Queen performance or something.
