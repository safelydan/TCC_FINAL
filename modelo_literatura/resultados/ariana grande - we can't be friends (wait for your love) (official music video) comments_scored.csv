"Ok hear me out, i dont think this song is about a lover. I think this song is about the fans and critics. She is speaking to us ""wait until you like me again"" as fans are easily persuaded and flip flop with their support. She can never be friends with her fans and critics. This was during a time a lot of people were hating her therefore she wanted to say a lot on her side of the story per verse 2 but would rather just stay quiet. My interpretation 😂 dont quote me. This doesnt make sense to me if it was for a lover, read between the lines",@ubzoo6090,2024-12-23T20:55:21Z,1,0.8891,Positive,Positive

It’s so weird how her lyrics are literally proving the of her cheating true but the MV makes everyone take a different approach the one which isn’t true at all and shifts ppls mind away from the truth and the fools are now praising her !!!

"I love this video so much..... This is one of the best videos I've seen in a long time.... Every frame every audio everything down to the detail.... Absolutely amazing.... If she was signed to a clause... An agreement not to talk about her relationship to Walton Gomez..... Well this video speaks for... Billions and billions and billions of women.... And Men 2 to be honest.... Of course.......... But I'm from the old school MTV days.... Where song and video connected..... But I'm not going to knock on the arrow where it was just songs about booty and same old same old and booty in your face g-string in your face while you're trying to watch a video and you're just waiting for the story but it that is the story it's just booty in your face and the song is just booty booty in your face..... There was an error where music reflected that reality for sure.....,. I'll take and learn from it.... But this video right here.... Everything about it from the shading the lighting the way they lighting exposes her certain parts of her body everything just tells a story what this lady has been going through..... She is so sacred.... She is a gem .....a treasure... She tells her story and I feel it so deeply dude and she speaks for so many many many many many many many many.... Billions billions billions..... But seriously... This is an artist that I truly enjoy... She's the kind of sister that I look at,. as she is a girl's girl..... She truly is..... Ariana Grande's sister I just want to say that you are perfect the way you are.... As an artist.....  a visual artist..... A little sister friend full of laughter.... I didn't know who you were 10 years ago... But I'm like wow.... I do remember Christina Aguilera singing in an interview.... She was Christina Aguilera said that she was into Ariana grande..... Makes perfect sense...... God bless you Ariana grande sister don't change anything about yourself... You're perfect girl.... Don't get anything done to your face your lips your teeth your eyes your hair nothing you are just perfect the way you are.... You are a beautiful soul inside and out..... And I thank you so much for your artistry..... It validates so many..... And your humor... Makes people smile.... Your voice is a frequency unmatched.... That's why I say you are a gem...... We have had many gems for sure..... But you're multi-talented multi dynamic.... Keep it pure sister and take care of yourself.... I know that so many love you so many appreciate you..... Billions and billions and billions and billions.... Donald Trump impersonation...🍟😂😆🤣🌈🤩💗💞💝",@Lisa-vj6pz,2025-04-26T21:21:35Z,1,0.9993,Positive,Positive

Give me your heart to Me.. I only want Your Heart.. GIVE it to Me Your Heart.. I need your heart.. I need HER.. I look through the Glass Jar..

Oink Oink.. My Heart has been telling me that I want to See YOU.. and I would wonder.. How would it feel to be close to You.. to be near YOU.. How would my Heart feel or react when I be close to YOU.. and since I am unable to see YOU.. this is the reason why it hurts me the most.. if YOU wonder about my Pains and why I deal with great sufferings..

I have been standing by this door.. for such a Long time.. for a while.. asking YOU to open the door.. I remember I was walking.. and I got a Note from YOU.. of course I would be by this door.. and I would be knocking at the door.. asking the door to be opened.. I would stay by the door.. I saw Hot sunny days.. and I would watch the night.. stars shines and Moon comes UP.. I would keep on coming to this Door.. a Note coming to my door.. and I saw a picture that was sent to me.. I fell in love with the picture.. but I did not know why it was left at my door.. as the note told me and gave me a direction.. but the door that I came too was shut.. it was closed and locked.. only thing I had in my hand was your Picture.. I wanted to meet YOU.. I am sitting and next to Me is the Basket.. Full of Flowers.. I am holding the Glass jar.. Looking down.. It is Empty Glass Jar.. I feel so Sad.. where are YOU.. Where are you My Love.. I miss YOU.. if You are Not with me Right now.. How about Imagining that YOU are Near.. I look down.. my two eyes Closes.. I am sitting.. the Glass jar has a Heart.. It is Your Heart inside.. and I want YOU to come and see.. See me and Your heart.. the Door Opens and I hear the Foot steps and stops.. I am looking down the Glass Jar.. and I say.. I am holding.. Can YOU see that I am holding.. there is a Heart inside.. Am I holding Your Heart.. will you tell me that I am doing the right Thing.. I want to have this Heart.. I want to hold it like this Forever.. Will you let me have Your Heart.. Because I love YOU.. I love YOU and I love Your Heart.. Only my wish is that YOU can give me the answer.. Please tell me that YOU are letting me to Love Your heart.. WILL you accept my Love.. can YOU receive that I want to fall in Love with YOU.. that I can start to love You until Now and Forever.. Please tell me that YOU are truly letting me to love Your Heart.. I am not asking for anything else.. But Only One.. It is Just Your Heart.. Now YOU sit next to me.. Is it really You.. I want Your Heart.. but is it really YOU.. let me have Your Heart.. I want Your Heart so that I can love YOU.. if I can't Love Your Heart.. there is No point of loving YOU.. because I want Your heart first.. Look at this Glass jar.. DO you see what I see.. I see A Heart.. SO beautiful because it is YOU.. Your Heart is so Lovely.. so beautiful.. Let me please Hold Your Heart.. I can't hold Your Heart because it is inside this Glass jar.. That is why I am asking YOU.. can YOU unlock.. give me your Heart.. take Your Heart and give it to Me.. let me please have and hold.. and to Love.. I am only asking YOU for a Permission so that I can love your heart.. why won't YOU let me Hold Your Heart.. WHY is there a wall between us.. why can't you Unlock so that YOU can give me your heart yourself.. Why do I have to just sit here and only thing I can do is looking through this Glass.. I do not want to look through this glass.. I don't want to just hold this Glass jar.. Do you know that I am much more driven then this.. that I want more.. I want more of it then just this.. I want the whole.. Your Heart.. if YOU know my intentions.. if you know how much I love You.. is it because YOU don't love me.. is it because YOU don't trust me.. is it because I am a stranger who only gives you that distance vibe.. BUT I am not like that.. you should know that I can be tender and very loving.. I can love you better than anyone else.. I can love you where YOU will say I do.. only if you can give me a chance.. give me a chance so that I can prove to you I am much more than this.. I see YOU stand Up.. I just can't believe.. are you leaving Me.. did I say something wrong that made you feel like you want to walk away from me.. why are you leaving when YOU came this close.. please don't go.. I have been waiting for you all this time.. and Now you want to leave.. you want to open that door and walk off from me.. then tell me what did I say that wants to make you leave.. I only want your heart.. why do you have to make it this hard on me.. don't go.. please don't go because I love you.. I grab Your hand.. Please.. don't go.. why are you hiding your face from me.. why can't you look into my eyes and tell me that you don't love me.. why can't you show me your real face to me.. don't go.. wait.. what have I done that makes you want to leave.. don't go.. don't leave me.. the hand pushes my hand away.. I see you open the door and walks away.. My Hand beats my Chest.. and Hits and hits.. WHY do you leave me.. I was so close right.. but I know that being close is nothing because this is what I get.. I want YOU.. I want Your heart.. Give me a chance.. YOU don't even give me a chance to love you.. then WHY do you have to push me away.. make me ache.. WHY.. I am hurt.. WHY.. I am hurting right Now.. WHY do you hurt me for.. I am only asking for One thing.. Just Your Heart,@devinjo2318,2024-11-16T04:37:14Z,0,0.9999,Positive,Neutral

I felt every frame of this video every part of it and I understood it.. very deeply...., the first time I heard the song I listen to it over and over and over and over and over a billion billion times..... And I could only imagine the visuals in my head... From the story from the song.... the video... Wow absolutely amazing...... Ariana grande is my favorite artist.... In the 90s it was Tori Amos... Bjork.... And of course Whitney Houston.... Play Christina Aguilera.. all day long.... And now I can't wait to get my 85 inch TV and my surround sound going again....

So DO not think that I have lost my mind.. and that I am going crazy.. But I do remember.. few says ago.. I put a Heart.. I have the picture here with me still.. I do remember waking up this Morning.. I turn to look across from laying on the bed.. I see the Glass Jar.. But.. I felt like something is Missing.. something is gone.. maybe my eyes are just messing with me these days.. as YOU grow older.. things will change but.. I know for sure.. it was YOUR HEART inside.. I remember holding this Glass jar.. I was weeping and jumping UP and down with Joy.. Holding this Glass jar with Your Heart.. because the Heart belongs to YOU.. NO ONE ELSE comes close with the Joy YOU give.. the chills I feel in my hands.. when I look at Your Picture and knowing that YOUR HEART was with me this Close.. I would be holding this Same Glass Jar.. JUMPING up and down.. it is Your Heart.. Only IF.. you can see the reaction I felt.. just holding this Glass jar.. with YOUR HEART.. my both eyes would be closed.. two lines of tears running down with JOY and HOPE.. just to have YOU close means it is YOUR HEART I want to love.. waking UP this morning.. My Heart felt heavy.. HOW did I lose.. Is it because of Me.. I must be the one to Blame because I have lost Your Heart.. How can I ask YOU for Your Heart if it is ME who has lost the Heart.. BUT I WANT.. I WANT IT.. I need.. I can't breathe without YOU and it is only when I have your Heart so Close.. When I was holding the Glass Jar.. with YOUR HEART inside.. I can feel my Heart beating against.. Knocking from the Inside because MY MIND would go crazy.. I would go Nuts having this Heart of you close to My Chest that It wakes UP MY HEART to keep on knocking.. I was laying down.. waking UP.. seeing that There was NO Heart inside this Glass Jar.. I started to stumble on the ground.. started to walk around.. room to room.. kitchen to rest room.. Looking everywhere for the Heart.. I know that YOUR HEART just did not run.. did it run from Me.. is your Heart afraid of Me.. I would kiss the Glass Jar looking at your Picture.. Looking at Your Heart.. maybe Your Heart got scared of me kissing Your Heart too much.. of course I could not touch YOUR HEART.. But I wanted to touch and hold YOUR HEART.. I really wanted to kiss into your Heart and would say.. this is HOW MY HEART feels when YOUR HEART is close to me.. close to My Heart.. it makes me want to bring YOU CLOSER to me.. and I want to hold YOU.. but I could Not find the Heart.. I went all around the House looking for your Heart.. and I am looking at Your Picture.. What am I suppose to say.. I have lost Your Heart.. I just can't tell you that.. How can I say that.. so I was thinking putting my Heart inside to act like it is YOUR HEART.. a Letter came to me asking me for Your Heart.. YOU have wrote me.. asking if I can give YOUR HEART back to you.. I am here confused.. I just have lost Your Heart.. YOUR HEART is NOT inside this Glass Jar.. it is Now Empty.. what do I do.. How am I suppose to come to YOU.. and show YOU that the Glass Jar.. I have lost Your Heart.. I don't know where YOU Heart went.. but I do know that I have the same glass jar YOU gave me.. I know this belongs to YOU.. but when I give YOU this Glass Jar.. I don't want to give it to YOU empty like this.. Because I have gotten Your Message.. YOU want Your Heart back.. I begin to wonder.. WHY are you asking for YOUR HEART back.. YOU told me that I can keep Your Heart forever.. YOU told me that I can Love Your Heart.. why all of a sudden change of Heart.. why are you changing what YOU gave.. I want to have Your Heart.. I want to keep Your Heart close to Me.. I want to enjoy having YOUR HEART.. even though I may Not touch It.. I can still Love your Heart.. just the presence of being Close.. it means everything to Me.. Now.. YOU are asking me.. at a time like this when I can't even find Your Heart.. I means.. I am holding this Glass Jar.. it is empty.. in the middle of the Night.. I am standing out here.. frustrated at this Point because I love YOU.. and I love Your Heart.. I want the Heart.. YOUR HEART to stay with me.. why did YOU send a message at the time I can't find Your Heart.. DID your Heart ran from me and somehow went to YOU.. I am sure your Heart was in this Glass Jar like yesterday.. I do remember.. like I said.. I was so Happy.. So full of tears and joy.. my arms wrap around the Glass Jar.. it had YOUR HEART.. and I would be jumping UP and down.. knowing this Heart.. YOUR HEART belongs to YOU.. and I be able to love and care.. and Tell Your Heart.. HOW much I wanted YOU SO CLOSE.. how is it possible to be so close with me and Now.. YOU are taking that Love and Joy away from me.. LOOK.. after the Message.. and I read it in front of YOUR HEART which was inside the Glass Jar.. that is when YOUR HEART ran from me.. it is after I received.. I open the letter and I was so Hurt.. so I read it very loud.. to make it clear.. YOU were going to take my Pride and Joy and Love from me.. so I would speak and I think YOUR HEART heard my words.. so Is it me.. I read from the Inside at first.. but it made me fill in rage because YOU wanted Your Heart back.. I can Love Your Heart more than YOU can hold that Heart.. I can tell Your Heart.. so that My Heart can breathe again.. can Beat again and I can also sing to Your Heart.. I may not have a GOOD voice to sing.. but I still can sing HOW MUCH I love YOU and the Joy YOU Bring when I am able to see Your Heart so Close and to able to Love YOU more and More.. why can't I just Love YOU.. if YOU leave Your Heart with me.. if Your Heart can stay.. I know I will love Your Heart completely.. I can make YOU Happy.. I can love you where YOU can be the most Beautiful Flower in the world.. WHEN I looked from the bed this morning.. and I searched the whole House and I did not find Your Heart.. I felt broken inside.. Like I begin to feel I am missing YOU.. that Joy broke down.. I have chased Your Heart away.. it is because YOU were asking me to give Your Heart back.. I would sit.. I pulled Out the Wine.. hard wine and I sat down.. LOOKING at the Picture.. and I would say.. How can YOU be like this to Me.. How can YOU take Your Heart away from Me.. it brought me the greatest JOY I never felt.. I open the top Lid.. and having the Shot Glass Next to Me.. I pour the bottle of Wine into the Shot Glass.. I grabbed the Shot Glass.. Open my Mouth and slam into my Mouth.. I would pour me two to three more Shots.. up to four on the Shot Glass.. and slammed the Hard wine into my Mouth.. and I would sit there.. could Not believe that YOU are asking for Your Heart.. YOU told me that I can Love your Heart forever.. YOU told me to take good care of your Heart and even gave me this Glass Jar.. I told YOU that I would.. I would make a promise to Love YOU.. to Love your Heart.. that means to love YOU... why are you doing this to Me.. putting sorrow.. putting pains.. making me suffer like this.. Missing YOU drives me crazy.. it hurts me because I need YOU close.. I need Your Heart.. Where are YOU.. Where is Your Heart.. I would pull the Trying to close Both of My eyes.. and eyes would Open again.. Both eyes would close once again.. but eyes keeps on opening.. I am laying Down.. thinking of You.. Keep on thinking How Beautiful you are.. I would sit UP from my Bed.. I am Holding the Glass Jar.. My arms around and My Head looks Down.. I am looking at your Heart.. Is this really YOUR HEART.. tell me that this Heart does not Belong to YOU.. because I am so In Love with Your Heart.. as Long as this Heart is Yours and YOU can tell me that It is YOUR OWN HEART.. I can Love YOU because I was made for a Time like this to Tell YOU.. to Tell this Heart.. I love YOU.. I am not sure if YOU truly want to hear these Words of Mine.. but.. I know that I am putting My Heart on the Line.. I know that I am putting Myself.. my Time on the Line just to tell YOU.. I love YOU.. I want to HOLD YOU.. like the way I am holding this Glass Jar,@devinjo2318,2024-11-16T04:34:50Z,0,1.0,Positive,Neutral

"This video hits different after having now seen the film. I got it before, but it has a deeper resonance now. Just spent my Sunday watching every Ariana Grande music video and I'm certain this is the best of her career, set to one of her very best songs. This era and the Wicked project have rehabilitated her image for me after the pits of 2019-2020. I do feel like I ""like her again."" Thank god for 2024!",@michaelcoppola7096,2025-02-09T20:21:13Z,0,0.9744,Positive,Positive

"Great pick me up positive and emotional song.  Glad you are about the music first and foremost and are not a sex symbol in this chapter and I feel it cheapens an artists talent if showing skin is part of the equation.  This is the best format, live performance with a band of great musicians who don’t need to dance around.  My two cents for what I think is best for Ariana’s career and legacy.  Good dress and clothing is attractive and classy and Arianna still looks great but as the good witch now.  Let me add any wealthy health advocate does intermittent fasting and has very low body fat as Arianna reflects now.  She might be the healthiest ever for longevity and people calling this anorexic have it wrong I think.   Peace out…TRap",@melodicaether6294,2025-06-18T23:31:15Z,0,0.9704,Positive,Positive

Love always hurts, it leaves scars, unfortunately that's how man is and because of pride he loses a lot! most often it is easier for us to hurt than to say a good or encouraging word, because inside we all suffer!

Her as a person and her aura and energy makes you feel her music so much more. She is truly a magnificent artist and I love her.

I think this element could have kept it a bit more lighter and dance- vibe like, without losing the weight of the song. I have to listen few more times. I loved the beat too.
