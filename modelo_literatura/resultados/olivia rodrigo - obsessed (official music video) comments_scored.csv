She did it again. Olivia somehow managed to be more generic than Taylor Swift. She carefully handpicked another one of the most generic situations in life and is pretending she wrote and filmed a masterpiece. The delusion is beyond. And the people who likes her music are the most basic I ever witnessed in my lifetime. That's impressive. What a load of shit.,@cedricqw,2024-03-22T15:43:27Z,2,0.8519,Positive

"Okay, lets analyze this with a summary. at 0:01, we can see 2 women. They both have pageants and it says ""Miss thought she was the one"" and ""Miss also thought she was the one,"" which can have several meanings on what its on. One, their his exes and they thought they were the one for him but they broke up somehow. They also dont seem very happy, and the blonde girl is smoking a cigarette to express emotional distress. Meanwhile, on this scene, 0:09 we can see that they are going to a ball. That could be another reason they thought they ""thought they were the one"" Meaning they didnt get to dance with the person they wanted. at 0:16, we see 2 women, ""Miss freshman year,"" and ""Miss our him in therapy"" Which can clarify these could be his exes. Now, ""Miss focus on my career"" could be the one Olivia is jealous over and and perhaps the somg is about. (A little side note after actually watching the video, 1:16 may actually the girl the song is about and therefore olivia is jealous of, unless its about more of than of them.)",@gutsicantspillfwd,2024-04-06T01:40:46Z,0,-0.9766,Negative
