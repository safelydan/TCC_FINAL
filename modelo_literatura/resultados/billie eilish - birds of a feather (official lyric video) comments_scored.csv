"Billie Eilish captures the intensity of devotion in 'Birds of a Feather,' turning love's fragility into something fiercely eternal. Her vocals are a beautiful reflection of the paradox of love both tender and unbreakable. The emotional weight behind this track feels like a whispered promise of forever, even in the face of inevitable goodbyes.",@LoversSymphony,2024-09-23T19:42:04Z,66,0.9442,Positive
"Easily Song of the Year. First time I listened to it on the album, for me it was an instant classic. I was craving for a song like this: simple, passionate and mostly universal. Anyone can vibe, from Gen Z to Baby Boomers, reminding of their teenage love.

"Two years ago, I had to distance myself from the girl I wanted to share my life with forever. Sometimes I still remember her in the little things she left behind in my life — especially in the music we used to listen to. She used to play “I Don’t Wanna Be You Anymore” every time we were together. This is the first time I’ve listened to the song all the way through; I’m sure it would’ve been one of our favorites. Hearing the opening melody always brings her to my mind, and for a long time, it used to make me tremble. Today, I missed her a lot — but something was different.

i wanna cry when i think about my brother while listening to this. he’s not the one to talk much or show his emotions to others but we have different ways to show each other we care. but last year my mum told me he had cried to her because he was worried and hurt by my health issues… that hit me extremely hard.

I was afraid- I'm always afraid of losing you. And like a cornered rat, I desperately did everything I know in order to keep you. Which made you further distance yourself. My heart still beats for you, and it aches at how far you distanced yourself. I don't know what to do anymore, so now I pray to your saint, Saint Juan.
