"For those who have been in relationships like the one described in the lyrics, they know the range of feelings it evokes, whether it's euphoria, anguish, melancholy, regret, and a series of others. Listening to this song from that perspective adds tremendous depth. It is quite heartless to listen from a first-person point of view, but the one who is in love, even if deluded, leaves a small door of hope for humanity.",@HermanoCavalcante-t7o,2024-06-19T19:42:05Z,194,0.8178,Positive

"Today it all sounds the same, repetitive not bad, well produced but in the end not very interesting. Often the better songs go back to the past. This one does that all too and yet, it catches attention. The secret? Not a lack of repetitive elements for sure, on the contrary but somehow it sounds like those who make it were inspired, liked this song themselves. It's shorter than usual.

He doesn't want for her to get attached, yet he likes that he kisses her in a way which indicates she misses him i.e. actually is attached.
