"I am a 59 year old woman and when I tell u that Kendrick has me turning this up EVERY SINGLE time. Dont know why it resonated with me waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy before I knew there was a beef. I just loved the beat and lyrics. But baebeeeeeeeeee, the SuperBowl performance had me with such great pride!!!!! As one of soldiers on the frontline of the movement from 60's to now, I must say I was so impressed and loved it. It got me into the rest of his music. Im highly impressed and proud of K-Dot. For the first time I feel like this young man brought generations together. Me my kids, grandkids and great grand vibe out to this anthem. Yes I SAID ANTHEM !!! Also with wats going on in our nation in 2025, baby we need this and so much more!!! I know I can speak for our nation when I say.

Who else would make a beef song the biggest hit of the year AND play it at the Superbowl with drakes ex serena. Even when Drake was at his best he still would have gotten completely destroyed.

I know all too well. I was exposed to sexual explicit hand made dolls @DFS interview at the principal office at school. They looked like cloth African American cabbage patch dolls will adult parts and they isolated me and showed them to me trying to get me to say something had happened to me.

"Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte, just delivered the bomb. Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen-footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. Heh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. Y'know, it's... kinda like ol' squares in a battle like, uh, you see in a calendar, like the Battle of Waterloo, and the idea was, shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin', and sometimes the shark'd go away... sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into ya. Right into your eyes. Y'know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites ya. And those black eyes roll over white, and then... oh, then you hear that terrible high-pitch screamin', the ocean turns red, in spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in and they rip you to pieces. Cage goes in the water? You go in the water. Shark is in the water. Our shark. Y'know, by the end of that first dawn... lost a hundred men. I dunno how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I dunno how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland- baseball player, boatswain's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... bobbed up and down in the water just like a kinda top. Upended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. Young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. Y'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest. Anyway... we delivered the bomb.",@yourrtrustyreviewer1692,2025-06-21T19:00:15Z,0,0.8636,Positive

I am sorry as an educated interracial woman I can’t comprehend this video much less his lyrics do to lack of enunciation. What is he trying to convey to the public? He looks dirty and scruffy much like his dancers too. Maybe I am missing something; being I lean more towards jazz and classical music. I am a highly educated woman in finance and I get that I am not suppose to understand these type of people! (Smh),@lieuthompson886,2025-04-07T06:55:38Z,0,-0.7777,Negative
