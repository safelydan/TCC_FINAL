"Not to maaajorly over-analyze, but that model expression is so unique to me. It gives the vibe that she's breaking the 4th wall, aware of the chaos around her, and still acting like she's currently posing for a magazine. It feels like she's still there as a full human person, like we're almost there, and she's not being just an idea or concept or character, she's human but still tapping into a boss part of herself. I think it's unique because most modelly expressions look detached and/or beyond their current situation and tend not to be grounded. I especially love it with the wine chaos going on - she's blinking wildly but she's still slaying. She keeps looking like she's battling the elements, even when there aren't elements to fight, and it's just so cool. Video modelling fr",@katara9,2024-07-18T15:05:18Z,7,0.91,Positive

Her voice is magical. Ever since Boom Clap I've just felt that her voice carries this energy. It's almost like even when she's belting out lyrics she's taking a bracing breath in as if she were about to jump off a high dive or something. That doesn't really make sense but it's the best way I can describe her voice. I'd venture to say that I'm not really her target demographic but I f*cking love this album and especially this song.,@royjones8312,2025-01-03T01:20:51Z,0,0.9422,Positive

"No idea who Charli xcx is or anyone else in the vid... was so lost till towards the end- when I got excited, cuz I saw/recognized Chloë Sevigny. Vibe turned bummed real quick with the realization ohh- kay, I'm OLD- THAT'S what's going on here. 😅",@samthraxx.,2024-08-13T00:56:12Z,0,-0.075,Negative

The best is fun and catchy. Almost sounds like something out of the late Y2K era. The music video is funny.,@GreenTRC1,2024-10-10T21:54:31Z,0,0.9122,Positive

"This song is already so good, but it hits so different when it reminds you of the level you've reached in life; where things are noticeably different with you and working in your favor. It took some time to get to the top, you're not jumping around or being dramatic about it- hence the steady and calm vibe. It's not about ego, you're just in a certain knowing of what you hold.",@jordanferguson2254,2024-05-17T21:31:01Z,0,0.9234,Positive

Never thought this girl Charlie could actually sing. Like all her songs are so easy vocally to say. Don't call this singing at all. No effort at all.  Does she even have full singing capability. Literally 🤔 wondering.,@natalievalenzuela7493,2024-08-10T13:05:58Z,0,0.6176,Positive
