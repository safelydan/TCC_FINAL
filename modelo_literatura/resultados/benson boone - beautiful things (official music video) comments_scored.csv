"Hi Benson, I've been faintly hearing this song on the radio in various stores I've gone into so I recently decided to look it up with the hook/chorus as my only thing to go off of.

"I am from Middle East I converted my religion. When my family learned they beat me, took my phone, laptop, bible etc. And locked me in a room for 1.5 years! I was just a 9 months old believer. When I was sitting in the room I prayed and said I don't have my Bible, my believer friends etc. how can I continue my faith? And I heard Holy spirit said I can come in this room! And he came he was with me all the time while I was in there. When I heard this song I felt someone who doesn't know my testimony made a song for me 😍 Yes he is in the room and he'll be in the room and we can't survive without him.",@Contemporary_Gospel,2025-06-10T02:12:05Z,5,0.9167,Positive,Neutral

"I can't believe it's been a year already, I remember when this said 1 hour ago. Spring and Summer 2024 was peak, but Summer 2023 was better. The summer vibe and chorus goes so hard, the vibe goes hard. 1 year since this went off the charts along with They Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar and many other great songs during 2024 and during Summer 2024. I'm already nostalgic for 2024, so much good happened. This year really sucks horribly with the plane crashes, the stock markets, everything, basically. I know I shouldn't be getting nostalgic for 2024, but that was my year getting out depression from Late Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, so I do miss 2020 - 2024 a lot.

"I was singing along with this song at the top of my lungs and the lyrics hit me like a truck. By the end of the song I was in tears (and still am.) this song played on the radio around the same time that my grandfather was suffering from cancer and the lyrics reminded me to pray for his health almost every day. I will forever miss him because he was the one who pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to sing along with his piano playing. Around 2-5 days before he passed, we played our favorite one for the last time. He couldn’t even play through the whole song because of the severity of this illness, but it really meant the world to me that he tried anyways. I miss every moment I had with him and hope that he is proud of me for still practicing until this very day. I’m still trying to get used to singing the song we played without balling up and crying my eyes out. thank you for sharing with us this masterpiece. ❤",@HeyItsMoonlite,2025-06-21T15:28:16Z,0,0.9836,Positive,Positive

His lyrics often speak to real struggles—love, heartbreak, identity—and fans around the world connect deeply with the vulnerability in his voice. Whether it’s through his music or his journey, Benson reminds us that it’s okay to feel deeply and to chase our dreams with passion and courage.",@YourmomMom-w5s,2025-07-19T21:00:38Z,0,0.964,Positive,Positive

Thank you Benson for creating such a powerful and emotional song. Jessica Sanchez sang it on AGT and completely nailed it — but it was your lyrics and melody that made it possible. You truly created a masterpiece. ❤🙏 #BeautifulThings,@Dominica-f3w,2025-07-18T18:40:22Z,0,0.9731,Positive,Positive

"This song reminds me of my last year of elementary school. It was a really sad vibe, as the school would be shutting down soon, and three teachers, including the principal, were retiring. On the morning of the last day of school, one of the third-grade classes was singing this song loud enough for the whole school to hear, and I just started crying. This song is a masterpiece, and it works its way into your heart, grabs hold, and doesn't let go.

"Gen X male over here. Normally I don't listen to the crap that's out now because most the music out now is crap, there's no thought process behind the writing. There's no respect for the pen anymore in music and everyone just throws shit at the wall to see if it sticks. There's VERY FEW artists I listen to as far as whats current because as I said, most music nowadays isn't for me. So for me to say this is not easy to say because I'm a HUGE critic and it takes ALOT for me to give a thumbs up. But this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and constructed from vocals, to instruments, just everything about this song was so beautifully and intricately constructed. Vocal range is insane especially when that high note is hit. I don't care how beautiful a voice you have, this is a hard song for anyone NOT named Benson Boone to sing.

"I heard ""Beautiful Things,"" and it was so amazing, just so deep. I didn't really know who the artist was at the time, but I thought it was sung by someone much older. Such mature concepts. I can't believe he's 22 and writes and sings with so much life experience. He's definitely going to become a superstar. I feel like I'm witnessing history in the making. Greatness. Benson Boone has stood out so much I had to google who this guy was. So far, I feel like everything he has made is a Hit. His music is on my playlist every day. He's definitely making me hopeful for this generation and its music. He's making music great again. Benson Boone, your music is definitely music people are going to listen to for generations to come, just like the music you listened to growing up. I wish you all the success and love.  Benson Boone, I'm rooting for you like family, I wanna watch you succeed 🤭🤗. I feel there's something very special about you. (Proverbs 3) and all God's favor to you.
