"I don't know why this song as a lead single polarized so many people and was deemed ""not as strong"". This is one of Taylor's most beautiful, mature songs and Post Malone harmonizes and fits in with it effortlessly. ""I love you, it's ruining my life"" is one of the most simplest yet heartbreaking lyrics I've ever heard. The sadness hits hard in this one with the rich melancholic vocal melodies.

I simply cannot not stop listening to this song and I can’t stop watching this Video. I am definitely A matured Taylor Swift Fan now.

"okay not a Taylor fan (I'm just an old school fan of rock and alternative)  but I'm here because of all of the hype in the  media, and today the news because she is doing 6 shows here in Toronto and this is seems to be the song that so many fans are most excited to hear so thought,  I really must just check out this one song and I have to say,  it's really great!!  Hope everyone enjoys the show!!  Taylor's popularity reminds me of the Beatles it's really quite incredible!!  Enjoy the music :)",@jayneyp8683,2024-11-13T11:56:31Z,0,0.9897,Positive

I love how Taylor contrasts the two characters: the girl who’s “cheer captain” and wears high heels versus the narrator who wears sneakers and listens to music in her room.
