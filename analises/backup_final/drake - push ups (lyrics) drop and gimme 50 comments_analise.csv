Neutral,The only thing Hard about this track after hearing Euphoria is the Beat,A straightforward observation about the track's beat.
Negative,Drakes song sounds better to the ears but Kendricks song is actually real as fuck. Drake can act hard all he wants and talk all this shit but at the end of the day everyone in the scene knows that lil bro is all bark and no bite and that homie came from canada and had a lil acting career and shit before he ever saw the fame he has now after pretending to be someone he isnt. Drake is not hard. Drake is not from the streets and made himself better. This is why people who have actually been in that life and been through that shit for real dont really care for drake like that. All good to be you but to portray this other character for extra clout or street cred is just beyond cringey now. His music still goes hard but definitely not against people with some real heart and soul behind their music and lyrics.,Strongly criticizes Drake’s persona and music as inauthentic and manufactured.
