Not only - it's actually the first time I watch this video-, that when I heard this tune some months back, that I paid attention to Ariana's music.. probably just really only knowing the collaboration with The Weekend, before. However, watching the video now & paying attention to the song's composition elements, it's so beautiful to see how she pays tribute to Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" in terms of choreography set up & execution - which back then, was actually a choreography tribute to Bob Fosse. 🥰. You will know, it's a definite tribute to Paula Abdul's video, when you see the window blinds go up to darken the dance studio at 2:25, when in Paula's video, the blinds get pulled down to darken the dance studio from 02:17-02:24. But also, the song actually seems to incredibly cleverly sample George Michael's beginning intro from ""Freedom 90'"" - just sped up & masterly cut into a fraction. So. But then also, culminating into beats resembling Madonna's ""Vogue"" just changed. Which would state the case, when the clay figures from 0:47-049 show Vogueing poses.. .

Neutral,"This song is the second edition of Madonna Vogue (listen to the lyrics and the sound and the context as well as the choreography!) I think I only like it because of this! It reminds me on the song vogue by Madonna. Also if anyone spotted it it's like you go in to watch a performance of a non-existent person (it's all fiction/false projection, just like a vampire or anything empty shell scenario being) because once it's not dark anymore and the light comes through the windows (covers being removed!) she literally turns into a wax/ceramic figure with her eyes being covered up. So she who encourages you to be free and do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be actually doesn't even have a life within herself therefore she's bined and under control or seriously disabled by her not even being alive but rather ""dead"" and just an empty vessel of some sort. The amount of direct opposites and counterfeiting statements and falseness (deceiving nature) of it all is crazy! She's saying words but they are essentially all empty...still it works because people are clearly hypnotized and put under a spell by the words that are being spoken rather they pay attention to the action behind the words. The whole coreography and all details in the movie are telling a completely different story that she's singing about. Very interesting! No one even cares to acknowledge this fact. Not to mention the groups attending these repeated (robotic shallow) performance (as it's depicted in the video to be like this with the symbolism all over it!) it's evident that each group is leaving with a higher spirit directly because of the performance: like someone programmed you to feel like that because it's also clear that they have no idea why they are acting like this and they still do (it feels like it's a rather subconscious programming going on! I heard M.K. U.L.T.R.A Really? Who knows right!? She covers her eyes. She's showing a black mirror and she's reflecting back at her audience. Very very interesting song and performance. Well done Ariana. You are a clever girl! 💯","Contains extensive, complex analysis and comparisons, with mixed praise and observations without a clear positive or negative leaning."
