"I'm a 27 year old straight black man and I love this song. I also like grins, you, and what  I like. What I like is special because I first heard it the summer before I went to college in 2014, I remember being so enthusiastic and happy about leaving my hometown and never having to go back to high school which I hated , yes I know it came out in 2013 but 2014 was when I first heard it . Everytime I hear it the memories and emotions from that summer come back",@andyusa14,2024-05-23T17:19:17Z,1079
I LOVE feel good music! The kind that makes you feel like you’re in the 1960’s floating on a cloud sipping lemonade in the summer with a nice breeze!!! “Say So” by Doja Cat gives me same vibe! Love this! ❤,@NotSo-Typikal,2025-05-22T03:32:28Z,11
"This is thrilling. Everything we could have wanted from her new era - it feels like all previous eras of Gaga are present on this record - we hear the virtuoso pianist, the rock star, the pop star, the jazz vocalist taking risks, the dark synth queen … and a totally unique artistic voice - one that can look at the whole of humanity good and bad and deliver something of beauty - with depth and emotional range and yet the same time - also still, to put simply - a catchy hook laden pop song! No one can touch her! Thrilling!",@st3vi3,2024-10-26T19:53:42Z,15
A true masterpiece of art and creativity.  The vocals are impeccable. The passion of music is life. Thank you Gaga for your time and works.,@geraldburns2328,2025-03-23T01:45:16Z,11
This song is a lot more harmonically sophisticated than it seems at first.  The modal shifts and dissonant chords really get under your skin... in the best possible way.,@MaximusNYC,2024-10-28T00:28:06Z,17
