First verse sounds so much like Rihanna
It's just ok. I wish the lyrics were a little better. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
"Well...not that great tbh (sorry for sharing opinion). Melody is to broken (chorus is ok), voice as always is good, lyrics a bit... juvenile (and give me cure vibe) - just not what I was expecting tbh"
Chorus is catchy but overall sounds dated. Don't think this'll chart well. Hope I'm wrong - excited for the album.
I love Sabrina so much but I really think she doesn‚Äôt deserve Best Pop Vocal Album Sabrina i love you so much and you‚Äôre slay album but there is no way your vocals win Ariana vocals,@adirdayan123,2025-07-10T14:00:48Z,2
