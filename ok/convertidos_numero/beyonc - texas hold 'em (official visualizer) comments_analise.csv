0,1,"I’ve never been a fan of Beyoncé, but this song can easily get lost in your head, and you can’t shake it. Besides that, I do have to say this.  Experimenting with different genres can help, until you find your voice, all new singers that break out into the music scene do this.  But for Beyoncé who’s been doing R&B, pop and hip hop music for as long as she has to jump ship to country is a big leap. Her voice is a powerhouse in the other genres of music and that’s been her vibe for all of her musical life. It’s great she’s expanding her repertoire and trying her hand at Country, and  Country musicians welcomed her with open arms to the country music  family.  But with her vocals mixing with country music is an absolute long shot. I admit country music isn’t what it used to be, it’s a little more poppy, but there some artist’s that love to go back to the traditional ways of what country music use to be. But in the case of Miss Beyoncé, there are already Country Queens. I’d rather her be in the zone where she has been labeled a queen in her more recognized career.",Expresses both admiration and skepticism towards Beyoncé’s genre shift.

This has nothing to do with her race either. Black people are the OG cowboys if you don't know. It's just super hard to believe that SHE is in any way country. The big city life Diva over sang in all her old Hip Hop and R&B cuts and now she is over singing in country, too. Whatever. But, how much support would Alan Jackson get if his next album was Gansta Rap? You tell me. M.C. Hammer tried to switch from Gospel Rap to Gansta Rap and he got slaughtered for it. (M.C. Hammer is more gangsta than 99.9% of ""Gangsta Rappers"". For real.)That's in the same genre! Art Official Age as the late, great, greatest of all time, Price put it. (If you don't know, look it up.) There is a reason why Darius Rucker was able to cross over to country; he only had to slightly jump over a narrow gap. Beyonce has an ocean to cross to connect her old to new.
