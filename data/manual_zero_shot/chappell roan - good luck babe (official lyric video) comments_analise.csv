Positive,"It's a good song, but looking at the lyrics as a story, it's possible the lover really is a closeted lesbian. But it's more likely that, the character Chappell is portraying is lacking self-awareness. The _contempt_ with which she says 'nothing but a wife' shows how she doesn't respect heterosexual relationships and that they can be loving too. So I think she's using her own lack of understanding/empathy towards straight couples to turn this into an 'us vs them' thing. Maybe her ex left her simply because of Chappell's personality, and she doesn't want to face that. So she blames straightness instead. 'You didn't leave me because I'm shallow; it's because you're in denial.'

Neutral,"0:33 Chappell's own lyric video gets the lyric wrong (although it's correct to the performance here). The 'official' lyrics are included in the video description and are different.
