Do you know how stupid this glazing is with Kendrick Lamar. He won 5 Grammys off a diss track. Backwards as f***. Nothing influential about a diss track. I can name a lot of records that should have got those awards. Only reason this happened was to try to make Drake obsolete. Keep trying. You can only beat Drake with Drake. Canadian r&b rapper has got the industry on lock and everyone is mad because they can’t beat him. Bunch of crybabies if you ask me. What happened to competition.
