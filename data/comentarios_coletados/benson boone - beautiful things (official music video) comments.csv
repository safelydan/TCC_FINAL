"Hi Benson, I've been faintly hearing this song on the radio in various stores I've gone into so I recently decided to look it up with the hook/chorus as my only thing to go off of. I'm a recovering alcoholic and this song gives me hope for my future but also helps to remind me not to be complacent. I wish you the best and I thank you for your art.",@Forbidden_Truth93,2025-06-11T00:20:58Z,13

"is truly one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard. It resonates with me so deeply that I listen to it every single day. I guess you could say I’m a little addicted to it, but it’s not just the melody it’s the emotions it stirs in me. I’m 45, still single, and sometimes I find myself wishing for someone who could love me with the same kind of passion and devotion that this song evokes. I long for a love that makes me feel extraordinary, even in my ordinary moments.",@douglasjefferson_9,2025-05-10T01:50:25Z,6

"I am from Middle East I converted my religion. When my family learned they beat me, took my phone, laptop, bible etc. And locked me in a room for 1.5 years! I was just a 9 months old believer. When I was sitting in the room I prayed and said I don't have my Bible, my believer friends etc. how can I continue my faith? And I heard Holy spirit said I can come in this room! And he came he was with me all the time while I was in there. When I heard this song I felt someone who doesn't know my testimony made a song for me 😍 Yes he is in the room and he'll be in the room and we can't survive without him.",@Contemporary_Gospel,2025-06-10T02:12:05Z,5

"I can't believe it's been a year already, I remember when this said 1 hour ago. Spring and Summer 2024 was peak, but Summer 2023 was better. The summer vibe and chorus goes so hard, the vibe goes hard. 1 year since this went off the charts along with They Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar and many other great songs during 2024 and during Summer 2024. I'm already nostalgic for 2024, so much good happened. This year really sucks horribly with the plane crashes, the stock markets, everything, basically. I know I shouldn't be getting nostalgic for 2024, but that was my year getting out depression from Late Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, so I do miss 2020 - 2024 a lot. This year hasn't been hitting in this crazy country and world we live in. Too many bad things are happening! I wanna go back so bad!",@matthewmichel6508,2025-07-25T00:32:33Z,0

"I was singing along with this song at the top of my lungs and the lyrics hit me like a truck. By the end of the song I was in tears (and still am.) this song played on the radio around the same time that my grandfather was suffering from cancer and the lyrics reminded me to pray for his health almost every day. I will forever miss him because he was the one who pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to sing along with his piano playing. Around 2-5 days before he passed, we played our favorite one for the last time. He couldn’t even play through the whole song because of the severity of this illness, but it really meant the world to me that he tried anyways. I miss every moment I had with him and hope that he is proud of me for still practicing until this very day. I’m still trying to get used to singing the song we played without balling up and crying my eyes out. thank you for sharing with us this masterpiece. ❤",@HeyItsMoonlite,2025-06-21T15:28:16Z,0

Give you a scientific explanation for the discrediting natural of psychological illness in dualism of Manichaeism and other during their time when subjected to malnutrition the psychological and temporary phenomenon of psychological abuse. You can consciously design the self made abuse in self experiment to identify your subconscious from your conscious mind. The exercise isn’t healthy in the short turn but I.

"Gen X male over here. Normally I don't listen to the crap that's out now because most the music out now is crap, there's no thought process behind the writing. There's no respect for the pen anymore in music and everyone just throws shit at the wall to see if it sticks. There's VERY FEW artists I listen to as far as whats current because as I said, most music nowadays isn't for me. So for me to say this is not easy to say because I'm a HUGE critic and it takes ALOT for me to give a thumbs up. But this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and constructed from vocals, to instruments, just everything about this song was so beautifully and intricately constructed. Vocal range is insane especially when that high note is hit. I don't care how beautiful a voice you have, this is a hard song for anyone NOT named Benson Boone to sing.

"I know the lyrics of this song perfectly because I went to here in Fuenlabrada last week, but my class of my another school put this song every single day but I still love it, this song makes me remember every moment that I’ve got with my class, I loved my class and my teacher because they are so funny and I was with my class five years! In the first year they bullied me but now they are my friends, I will remember them forever 😊",@张嘉琳-t7x,2025-05-26T19:15:03Z,0

"I heard ""Beautiful Things,"" and it was so amazing, just so deep. I didn't really know who the artist was at the time, but I thought it was sung by someone much older. Such mature concepts. I can't believe he's 22 and writes and sings with so much life experience. He's definitely going to become a superstar. I feel like I'm witnessing history in the making. Greatness. Benson Boone has stood out so much I had to google who this guy was. So far, I feel like everything he has made is a Hit. His music is on my playlist every day. He's definitely making me hopeful for this generation and its music. He's making music great again. Benson Boone, your music is definitely music people are going to listen to for generations to come, just like the music you listened to growing up. I wish you all the success and love.  Benson Boone, I'm rooting for you like family, I wanna watch you succeed 🤭🤗. I feel there's something very special about you. (Proverbs 3) and all God's favor to you. You are Blessed for Success.",@kayn421,2025-05-15T08:19:24Z,0
