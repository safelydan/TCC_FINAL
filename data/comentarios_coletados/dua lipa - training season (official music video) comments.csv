"I'm a metalhead, but I always love everything what Dua does. We, from the part of Europe that has always been slapped by history, somehow we have a special taste in common.These are special emotions😉",@hrcodrums,2024-04-11T21:48:58Z,22
"I'm 68 and I've been a music fan since the Beatles first appeared on Ed Sullivan in 1964. I've been Dua's fan since her first Graham Norton appearance in 2019?. People I'm telling you, if you never settle for just one genre of music, from any specific era, you'll never feel old. Great music is made every year and you have to just stay open to it. Dua is incredible and I'm so glad that I'm not missing out on her talent because of my age. Age bias is a terrible thing to give in to, don't let it happen to you.",@macbirt56,2024-04-11T18:10:38Z,18

When that second chorus hits and the extra layers of vocal harmonies come in and they way they're layered with those tasty guitars oooo man! The mix on this song is really great. Can't wait for this new album.,@stennesmusic,2024-04-04T15:26:36Z,9
kevin going crazy with these songs!! fits so well with dua's vibe and voice,@thetrashbaby,2024-02-24T17:42:37Z,9
"I like the beauty of Hollywood how dua lipa describes her relationships as simple ""training season"" however, Hollywood never had training things and seasons because creativity, beauty of pure nature, experimentations, heart breaks, and overall connection, community, and emotions waving out as waves poring life into the whole industry and the world cannot be moulded through ""training seasons"" ❤",@OsamaAzam-kk8mb,2024-06-14T18:22:19Z,8

Training Season by Dua Lipa is melody excitement at its finest.  The humorous and imaginative way that Dua Lipa is portrayed in a hypnotic and alluring way is also part of the music video enchantment.,@stellacarrier8341,2025-03-06T04:25:31Z,5

Wasn't sure about this song the first time i listened just because its got very different chords and structure than most pop but after a few listens i really like it just for that reason.,@briancrawford69,2024-02-18T01:09:27Z,4

"🤔😐Do you know what the most important thing in the world is🌎🌍 to do? It's not making money,💰💰 it's not eating,🎂🍰 or drinking,🍷🍾 much less playing games.♠♣♟ We came into this world with nothing, and we will leave it with nothing. Here everything is temporary, but on the other side everything is eternal. So the most important thing is to follow God, read the Bible, attend an evangelical church and prepare yourself for that day that you don't know when it will come; otherwise, you will descend with the other👺 into a suffering that will never end.😰😭😫",,2025-02-28T23:50:07Z,0

And it is so much fun to dance. I want you to teach me how to dance to count someday. ... If you ever see a Elton John again, if he tells you he is straight, then be nice to him. If he tells you he's gay, then tell him to leave you alone. If he doesn't leave you alone, then beat the living hell out of him. ..... Dua Lipa, nobody hits high pitch vocals like do. Not even close. How do you do that? It is so amazing. Those high pitches you hit feel so good on my ears. I can't wait for you to explain to me how you get your voice to do that. You are the only one who does that.

"The autumn equinox painting, the yellow waltz preamble of the season trees, is an emotional psychological theatrical scenario of the composition of the colors displayed on the heavenly wall; the sincere gray is amalgam  with the light of afterglow, in the shades of all the perpetives of the firmament !!!  The vision of the mermaid took place on the blue stone of the sea, and under the great mouth of the moon, which sang in the tuning fork of the watery world of whales and dolphins; capturing the senses of sailors and fishermen; and waking up the deep sleep of the rocks in the infinity of oceanic thoughts!!!  A  pintura do equinócio outonal, o preâmbulo da valsa amarela das árvores da estação,  é um cenário teatral psicológico emocional da composição das cores exibidas na parede celestial;  o cinzento sincero se amálgama com a luz do arrebol, nos tons de todas as perpectivas do firmamento!!! A visão da sereia aconteceu sobre a pedra azul do mar, e sob a grande boca da lua, que cantava no diapasão do mundo aquático das baleias e golfinhos; capturando os sentidos dos marinheiros e pescadores; e acordando o sono profundo dos rochedos no infinito dos pensamentos oceanicos!!!  La peinture de l'équinoxe d'automne, préambule de la valse jaune des arbres de saison, est un scénario théâtral psychologique émotionnel de la composition des couleurs affichées sur le mur céleste ; le gris sincère s'amalgame avec la lumière de la rémanence, dans les nuances de tous les perpétifs du firmament !!! La vision de la sirène a eu lieu sur la pierre bleue de la mer, et sous la grande bouche de la lune, qui chantait dans le diapason du monde aquatique des baleines et des dauphins ; capturer les sens des marins et des pêcheurs ; et réveiller le sommeil profond des roches dans l'infinité des pensées océaniques !!! La pintura del equinoccio de otoño, el vals amarillo preámbulo de los árboles de temporada, es un escenario teatral psicológico emocional de la composición de los colores que se muestran en la pared celestial; ¡¡¡El gris sincero es amalgama con la luz del resplandor, en las sombras de todas las perpetivas del firmamento !!! La visión de la sirena tuvo lugar sobre la piedra azul del mar, y bajo la gran boca de la luna, que cantaba en el diapasón del mundo acuático de las ballenas y los delfines; capturando los sentidos de marineros y pescadores; y despertando  el sueño profundo de las rocas en la infinidad de pensamientos oceánicos!!! Il dipinto dell'equinozio d'autunno, il preambolo del valzer giallo degli alberi della stagione, è uno scenario teatrale psicologico emotivo della composizione dei colori esposti sulla parete celeste; il grigio sincero si amalgama con la luce degli ultimi bagliori, nelle sfumature di tutti i perpetui del firmamento!!! La visione della sirena ebbe luogo sulla pietra azzurra del mare, e sotto la grande bocca della luna, che cantava nel diapason del mondo acquatico delle balene e dei delfini; catturare i sensi di marinai e pescatori; e svegliarsi  il sonno profondo degli scogli nell'infinito dei pensieri oceanici!!! Das Herbst-Tagundnachtgleiche-Gemälde, die gelbe Walzer-Einleitung der Jahreszeitenbäume, ist ein emotional-psychologisches Theaterszenario der Komposition der Farben, die an der himmlischen Wand angezeigt werden; Das aufrichtige Grau verschmilzt mit dem Licht des Nachglühens, in den Schattierungen aller Perpetiven des Firmaments !!! Die Vision der Meerjungfrau fand auf dem blauen Stein des Meeres und unter dem großen Mund des Mondes statt, der in der Stimmgabel der Wasserwelt der Wale und Delfine sang; Entführung der Sinne von Seeleuten und Fischern;; Den tiefen Schlaf der Felsen erwachen lassen, in der Unendlichkeit ozeanischer Gedanken; am unendlichen Grund der Ozeane!!!
