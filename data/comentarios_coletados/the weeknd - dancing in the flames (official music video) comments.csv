I'm hoping he releases a deluxe version of _Hurry Up Tommorow_ like he did w _After Hours_ w this version as well as the accepella and acoustic version on it. I'm really hoping that's the reason this was not on the inital album release.🤞🏼,@NaomiCantora,2025-02-01T01:36:12Z,5

"In my mind, ""dancing in the flames"" is like being on a dirt field, surrounded by fire, hammering the pedal swinging around the back end, kicking dirt over the fire to try to put it out, like that one fast and furious movie where he kicks up dust and reverses off the cliff. ""The exhaust is red-hot, engine is running hot, tachometer reads redline, but the flames still stand, and the car is still fighting the flames, making a beautiful ruckus.""",@bobbylobby820,2024-10-01T08:48:58Z,3

His songs with every album evolve more and more into synth80s and Michael Jackson styles which I love more and more.  Before it was one or two songs now it’s about half of an album. Getting better and better.,@norbkowa,2025-04-18T03:38:06Z,1

Sometimes in life two people who can be so in love with each other but aren’t in a relationship have to say goodbye. Like you both understand each other and deep down maybe you two did love each other or maybe it was only one sided & maybe the person who thought loved you was just being nice. Anyway this is what this song feels like two people who were in love had to split up for whatever reason.,@Itsnoahscott,2024-10-10T12:27:40Z,1

"Io our dreams (literally) and subconscious, the car represents our body and soul, if we dream about driving a car it means how we are moving in our lives. Infact, in the music video he get into a car accident but we don't  really see any other car. Grabbing our wheel of life and deeply understanding when it's time to stop (""missing the break"") could literally save us. The entire video is a rhetorical representation. Also, there is almost a near to death experience in this video in which he get up after the accident and he starts running towards the light but when the ambulance arrives, he didn't move at all, he is still on the ground.. anyways I love how he transposes his experiences and growth as a man into music and videos + this track is more than amazing. It gives strenghts to always go on in life. Sorry for my english I hope this makes sense :)",@TheGiubani,2024-09-23T19:27:24Z,0

"This video and song actually has me feeling so emotional right now. It so captures how it feels to be in a near death experience. TRUE STORY TIME: I was in a massive tent fire last year. I fell asleep in a tent and woke up to a propane tank blasting my upper left side with flaming propane, and a third of the tent on fire. I still have no idea what started the fire. But it was a homeless encampment and lots of them have been set on fire especially as of lately. I woke up to that and jumped out of the tent over some of the flames and when I looked back the place I was just sleeping was fully engulfed. By the time the firefighters had put it out, both the tent and all around it in a 15 metre radius was completely decimated. Anyways, when the paramedics gave me Ketamine to sedate me as I was panicking and going into shock with the burns on me, it felt exactly like this video. I was out of my mind on Ketamine but it was deeply spiritual. This is also how the fire felt. Everything was in slow motion. It felt like I was experiencing a lifetime in those moments. I also felt a heavy sense of foreshadowing. It felt like I was running against time and fate and wondering if I would make it to where I was running in time or not. This video perfectly captures that for me. Well done",@katrinasteines-shopa5971,2025-06-25T22:08:39Z,0
