"This makes me sad, she has so much talent she doesn’t need to sell sex to be successful. My favorite music videos are of hers that show case her vocals and dance ( grew up watching her dance) I don’t like that now she’s gotten so popular that she is showing so much sexual content it’s off putting and saddens me Hollywood has really gripped onto her. I wish she was authentic like she was when she made lower production music videos and made it about just her vocals and dance.",@emmasmith7841,2024-09-25T07:55:08Z,63

"We finally have this generation's answer to Britney Spears. We thought the sex was turned up with Britney. (and initially- it was HER idea to sex up her image. go awf queen) But with Tate-- its turned up to an 11. She's definitely her own artist, but the Britney references and influences are definitely there. And thats a major compliment. Unique vocal tricks. Sexy, powerful, dance focused, fun pop sound. I mean... the brown and denim outfit is totes  Britney ""Slave 4 U""-coded. The opening outfit before the naked arrest was basically the exact outfit Britney wore for the promo shoot for the 2000 VMAs. Head to toe inspo. Then, we get ""I Wanna Go"" video vibes with the indecent exposure and getting naughty-arrested. I repeat, COMPLIMENT. This is a y2k gay guy's dream. A true ode to tge 2000s and an authentic pop-gasm oozing with tongue-in-cheek sex appeal and fierce fabulousity.",@probablyjoeyy,2024-10-24T11:44:47Z,7

She has no emotion,  no expression,  no artistic value,  no story to tell. It's just monotone depressing self loathing angry hatred repeated over and over an over.

I’m obsessed with the anyway Adlibs on top of the second chorus she should’ve done that for the first chorus it would’ve been a bigger hit then,@Luxebeam,2024-12-11T22:35:13Z,0
"Her lyrics are hard to follow lol it kinda sounds like in the chorus "" i don't want any white girl to take you,""  lol and i thought she said ""what about the slave position""😅 lol i thought it was kinky but she said same position. She sounds like Justin Bieber before he went through puberty i just listen to this song but the slow down version so i can make out the lyrics and this girl is a female Bieber lol",@brirashrn5445,2024-10-12T14:08:04Z,0

"It’s ok I’m ok was the best phrase I’ve ever heard thank you Tate so much, my heart can’t handle how powerful it is 🧡",@SealSeal-db5pv,2025-02-21T07:41:36Z,0
"1:26 Here, Tate's choreography is awesome. It makes me want to dance along with this music 😆 Also, the lyrics sound paradoxical. As we know, the more a girl says ""It's okay, I'm okay,"" the more not okay she becomes 😂",@Sophia_sunflower.,2024-09-29T00:08:30Z,0

"Though Tate is very talented with good vocals and has a loyal fanbase, it looks like she has come to this realisation about what actually sells in the industry. And unfortunately talent isn't one. I have followed her since I didn't know she could also sing and was only a dancer, and I have always thought she was very talented. But talent is only gonna get you so far. Everybody wanna see you naked these days. Specially female artists in the showbiz.",@badalj0elrai,2024-10-02T19:10:24Z,0
