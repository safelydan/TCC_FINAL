"I love that these remixes are ACTUAL remixes, and not just added verses. We got a totally new album and I'm here for it!",@mikaylierae8659,2024-10-11T12:38:53Z,5612
"This song isn't only iconic, it's very relatable too. Some people just be saying things, acting sympathic and all but they truly only want the worst for you.",@ilovechai2520,2024-12-04T15:46:20Z,745
"The vocal layering and adlibs of ariana is fucking insane, takes the song to different level. Like just listen to the adlib of ""on top"" at 1:32. Just perfection",@PrakharMishra-ww8kq,2024-10-11T12:39:31Z,456
AG and easy fun are seriously the OG COOKs. Period. The vocal layers and that high note arpeggio is such a unique and ethereal melody structure. Aris voice worked well with the robotic auto tune effect. So many gems to this piece love it,@elishamiyahira4301,2024-10-13T08:20:22Z,347
Ariana producing amazing vocals as always I literally have goosebumps @ 1:35,@47badddie,2024-10-11T04:27:31Z,187
ariana's background vocals and adlibs are the best things in the world!!,@vebyfachrudin,2024-10-12T00:32:52Z,133
Why would they remove that gorgeous chorus? I was looking forward to Ariana singing that part but I still love it,@moonbeam5841,2024-10-11T04:07:56Z,115
"the ariana's verse remind me so bad her unreleased song ""oh darlin"", I love itt",@dantealexxander,2024-10-11T04:01:57Z,70
"Sprained my finger clicking on this so fast. Was not disappointed. This is what remixes are supposed to be. Adding to the creativity of the original not just slipping in one extra verse before the bridge. Like it or hate it, this [Charlie's entire brat era] is artistic expression at its finest.",@lenan5913,2024-10-11T05:10:50Z,41
"""It's a knife when you know they're counting on you mistakes"" these lyrics is so relatable to my life at school cuz my "" friend"" backstabbed me",@et3rn4lsunsh1ne,2024-11-24T11:31:20Z,32
1:03 Is where ari’s verse starts… I think,@AdrianaTall-b5h,2024-10-11T13:36:46Z,13
"2024 is really the year for Ariana to showcase her  talent in different genre like house, synth pop, R&B, opera, ballad, hyper pop and experimental pop as well.",@zeit_guise,2024-10-11T09:31:54Z,13
This is already giving me SCREAM 1996 vibeszzzz!!! 💖💅,@bahajarvis,2024-10-11T05:29:04Z,13
This is the kind of song you hear once and can't stop! The two artists created such a unique vibe. 'Sympathy Is a Knife' is everything! 💯🎉,@Mundo_dos_desenhos45,2024-11-22T13:46:28Z,12
ARIANA NEVER MISSES WITH HER BACKGROUND VOCALS AND HARMONIES🔥,@INFINIX_000,2024-10-11T10:32:22Z,11

This song is making my heart beat faster! Charli XCX and Ariana Grande's voices complement each other in such an amazing way. Pure perfection! ✨,@Mundo_Pony,2024-11-22T13:41:43Z,9
"Fact: Charli xcx and Ariana Grande vocals are not a joke y'all. Their vocals are so always and forever angelic, beautifully, breathtaking, healing, mesmerizing, perfect, soft, soothing and outta this world! 😳😭❤",@StrayKidsTheFutureofKpop,2024-10-11T04:37:34Z,9
"The repetition of “It’s a knife when” without finishing the statement makes this even more powerful to me, it just feels like an open-ended and relentless barrage. It ties into the song’s original meaning so nicely. 💚",@blackbaptism,2025-06-26T14:00:55Z,9
"I didn't like it at first listen since I was disappointed since I wanted the original beat, but somehow after a few times listening I fell in love with it.",@pedromachado3109,2024-10-11T17:13:11Z,8
Thank Charli. Thank you Ari. Thank you art. Thank you music. Thank you world. Thank you universe. Thank you god. Thank you everybody 🥹🥹🥹,@cestpromesse,2024-10-28T21:10:52Z,7

"This really takes me back to when I was big on twitter and the same people that ""loved"" me (often to the point of sexual harassment) decided to switch up and cancel me just to feel better about themselves. I even faced catfish allegations lol. These lyrics are too personal.",@feeb4007,2024-10-11T08:49:02Z,5
"ariana's lyrics are ass XD omg, this is charli's album not hers....it sounds like lyrics ment for her album that talks exactly about the same thing which also has ass lyrics...im sorry, this was a miss for me.",@metanoiia_,2024-10-11T19:39:30Z,5
these are some AMAZING vocal harmonies! wow,@tshhcfy66,2025-01-06T12:43:09Z,4
This stinks. Sympathy is a Knife is the standout track on Brat for me. The melody is gone now. Just make a new song you lazy shook ass dorks,@yesthatjake5601,2024-10-11T14:54:22Z,4

I like it but where’s the chorus?,@sir.dracarys,2024-10-11T04:19:19Z,3
"For all those whining about wanting Ari to just hop on the original SIAK and just add a verse, not only is that boring, but it wouldn't work. That song is about a specific person, and that person is NOT Ari.",@Sai-pf4ft,2024-10-11T13:28:09Z,3
Please say this remind you of Arianas verse on I don’t do drugs,@krystal_Versace,2024-10-11T13:07:41Z,3
It's a knife when some random ass dude said the original version was better... Are we even listening to the same lyrics? Yo wtf hahaha,@neil4121,2025-02-07T06:51:08Z,2
