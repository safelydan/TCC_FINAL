"I am 63 and have listened to a lot of music as I love music. I really hope Benson becomes one of the greats of the 21st Century. Such a pure voice with a great vocal range. It has been a while since I have heard a male's voice that I really enjoy. In fact, the last 10 years I have mostly listened to female singers. But this young man has a talent in singing and song writing that I admire so much. A true talent.",@BatMan-oe2gh,2024-04-15T12:22:14Z,1581
It's so refreshing to hear a love song about a son's love to his mother and at the same time professing his love to a girl. Such great lyrics and a breathe of fresh air amongst the noise of music being produced right now. Benson is an international treasure! We must protect him at all cost!,@kokocute123,2024-04-01T10:24:56Z,734
"Hard to believe someone so young can sing with so much soul-deep emotion. He's either had his heart seriously broken or feels the emotion of others....maybe both. Whatever it is, it's amazing. True, God-given talent.",@stonecountybetty,2024-06-19T11:30:39Z,610

"Your song writing and your music which reflect your authentic self, your broad vocal range and amazing voice in general (it gives me goose bumps), being so accomplished at playing multiple instruments..... You are pure talent and passion and still so young, you're incredible. In my opinion the best new artist and music I've heard in many years. I've watched interviews you gave and you you were asked about your moustache in one of them. You don't need it to look older or prove anything (you actually look better without it, but that's just my take). You are a star and you will continue to rise higher and shine brighter. So what if you have a ""baby face""? You'll be glad of it when you're older and look younger üôÇSame goes for your stage costumes, jewellery and red carpet outfits. When compared to your earlier videos and appearances, which you look absolutely great in, it seems that more recently you adopted a persona. It's fine if that's your personal style but it's jars with your authenticity, your fun, down to earth, genuine attitude and your beautiful music. If you have stylists or managers or whoever, advising you to dress that way, ditch them üôÇSurplus to requirements. You and your music are astounding without all the ""frills"". I hope the music industry doesn't try to turn you into something they want you to be. Dan Reynolds, who's music I also love and who's music label you're signed up to, is a case in point. He's just comfortably and authentically himself whether he's hanging out, giving interviews, performing or recording music videos. When the artist is as good as you and the music is as phenomenal as yours you don't need any embellishment. Just the irrelevant opinion of someone who is grateful you found out you could sing and are now sharing your amazing talents with us. Thank you!",@sharyncamilleri3522,2025-02-23T11:36:46Z,2
