"This song convey a sense of resilience and strength in the face of challenges, drawing imagery from everyday toughness like old leather boots, blue-collar attitudes, and family heritage (like grandpa's glass). The repetition of ""tough"" emphasizes this theme throughout the song, highlighting perseverance through difficult times and the bonds that keep people strong.

"I haven’t heard a Lana Del Rey song in a long time. I used to be a huge fan of hers and that’s an understatement. Her voice would kind of put me in this trans and mood that would amplify feelings that I already had or would bring about feelings that I didn’t even have before. Negative feelings. This goes for all secular music, but the reason I’m commenting on this video specifically is because of how much her music impacted me and how I felt all of my young adult life. today I thought let me see what Lana has been up to. I heard the song and something about it troubled me when I started to listen to it because it was almost nostalgic and I was getting those feelings that a lot of people talk about getting whenever they hear her music. Anyhow, I began listening, and immediately thought oh my gosh, I really like this. Her voice is amazing. Their voices are amazing together, but as I kept listening to the song, I realized that she says lords and that was the end of this song for me as a Christian. And if there’s any question, especially listening to this song I just want to remind you  that there is one Lord, and the symbol for the one and only Lord is that of a cross, which is posted on the house in this music video. I just wanted to say that don’t get it twisted because that’s what is happening with music nowadays they are getting it twisted, mixing new age and Jesus. If you don’t think it’s that serious, we know how salvation works and it’s been confessing with your mouth so what you say is important. I say this out of love and as a reminder, but as you know, we have free will and it’s up to you to decide what you do with that.",@Enerodrive,2025-07-10T00:01:39Z,1

I think it’s wrong he’s rubbing Selena in his face when everyone just found out he was sexually assaulted & abused for years by diddy and others. He’s fragile state of mind right now.

Anyone can literally make up a beat throw auto tune on it,and BAM they're a rapper and today's generation goes crazy over it. I don't understand.
