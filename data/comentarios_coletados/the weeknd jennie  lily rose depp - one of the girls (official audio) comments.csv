"Jennie, The Weeknd and Lily Rose Depp collabing together is absolutely amazing. The Idol is a awful series but it does however have a really good soundtrack. This is one of the best one's alongside Fill the void, lesser man and Double Fantasy",@DFASTXFilms,2023-10-12T22:18:50Z,4565
"Lily's voice, oh my God, I can't stop listening to it. Her voice made the song sound so much better. It's really amazing. Her voice is so beautiful. I feel like I'm in another world. We want more of Lily's wonderful voice! The tone of her voice, oh my God, is really the best voice in this song. Her voice really gives me goosebumps because of its beauty. I cannot stop listening to it. They saved me. I fell in love with her voice!!!!",@v7555-i7s,2023-11-06T15:44:55Z,1907
"I am totally in love with this song, Jennie's bold and deep voice and Lily's sweet and alluring voice gets me everytime and let's not forget Weeknd they all compliment each other, I especially loved Jennie's part a lot <3",@YuriIsOnYt,2024-03-18T07:40:23Z,1057

2:39 It sounds so good when he vocalises while lily sings.,@happyme450,2024-10-21T18:30:11Z,464
"The Weeknd’s seductive vocals are already mesmerizing, but when Jennie and Lily-Rose jump in, it’s pure vocal perfection. Jennie’s sultry tone adds fierce contrast, while Lily-Rose’s whispery delivery brings haunting vulnerability. Together, their voices create a hypnotic mix of desire, temptation, and heartbreak. Masterpiece!",@narutootsusuki970,2024-10-03T14:07:34Z,443
"The lyrics express the singer's desire for a relaxed, no-strings-attached encounter. They're not in pursuit of a lasting relationship or aiming to be someone's special partner. Instead, they simply want to share time with the person as a companion without any romantic commitments. It's a straightforward message about seeking a temporary connection without getting emotionally entangled.",@jstnflyd,2023-10-18T07:28:12Z,441
