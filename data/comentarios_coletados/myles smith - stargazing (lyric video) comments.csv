This is my new favorite song and I cannot stop listening to it. Thank you for the music, for the lyrics, and for your talents.  I can't wait to see, hear and learn more about you and your music.

"This makes me realize..just how silly we can be..when we think we need things.. a bigger house, when you already have a peaceful home? More security in a relationship that was already perfect..we never know how much time we have on this earth..so to anyone reading this.. JUST TELL THEM.. say what you feel, appreciate what you have, don’t fall into the pit of needing something more, it’s an endless cycle of never being satisfied.. if you love someone, tell them, if you have something like the lyrics in this song..don’t let it go, work for it, try, life is too short ❤",@LizzieMarie1111,2025-01-04T05:47:35Z,0
