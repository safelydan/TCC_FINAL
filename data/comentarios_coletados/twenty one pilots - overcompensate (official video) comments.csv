"WHY I DONT SEE ENOUGH CREDIT about how SMOOTH is the tempo change at 1:35. Cause Its not just two random tempos. Josh plays the fill with triplet notes and then makes them the ACTUAL Downbeat and in fact turns them into 16th notes and stays there. Such a cool idea, blew my mind while the first listening (still blowing)",@maximgvozdetskiy5884,2024-03-01T21:21:52Z,1122

Josh's drumming on here and the production are both clllllllleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnn. Tyler's flow is better than anything we've gotten from them in 5-6 years. The tone is back to having some darkness. Welcome back to Trench. A reintroduction in the grandest way.,@brandonrust4114,2024-03-06T23:16:48Z,235
"Literally can‚Äôt stop listening to this. The intro is like being in a movie, the call back to previous albums with the Bandito lyrics and ‚Äúwelcome back to trench‚Äù is a reference to the last 15 seconds of Levitate.

Lol fueled by ramen acts like our president himself listens to it. I'm just a teenager trying to stay alive. I understand the lyrics of Next semester. This week was very hard mentally and physically. There was a big shooting in Moscow. I'm so scared of it and i don't want anybody to die. Also there's so much homework at school and i have to choose my job for the rest of my life and write the exams. I'm very nervous and the only thing that helps me is the music of these guys.

"Josh is an incredibly dynamic drummer.  I think he'll be listed right up there with the greats of rock and roll.  Tyler is highly underrated as a rapper, mostly because he can actually sing as well.  This song is highly polished production wise, but I'm going to have to find the lyrics, because it's a bit too fast for me to grab just playing it.

"‚ÄúIlluminati Hand Symbol‚Äù? No.. not originally at least. that‚Äôs part of the point of the story of Trench. Remember the song ‚ÄúLevitate‚Äù? Tyler did his history! He was referring to the Knights Templar, formerly known as ‚ÄòBrothers of/from the East‚Äô.. ‚ÄúEast is Up!‚Äù remember ‚ÄúNico & The Niner‚Äôs? Anyway, the Brothers of the East could levitate.. they had many spiritual gifts that weren‚Äôt so common (not ‚ÄòMagic‚Äô in the sense that they refer to today) no.. sorta like Jesus Christ. They in fact admired Jesus Christ.. they were acquainted perhaps. However, they had a great respect for John the Baptist because he is said to have been the one who helped & assisted Jesus Christ with understanding and further developing his spiritual gifts. Here with Twenty One Pilots, Tyler is going pretty deep! & yes it does insight a certain ‚Äúelite‚Äù group of ppl as the said ‚Äúilluminati‚Äù.. but not because they‚Äôre apart of it! No.. It‚Äôs because he over-stands how it all came to be about. Through some sort of ‚Äòinfiltration‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt mean to write a story here. But I‚Äôve been piecing this all together myself. And if you listen to the music closely, Tyler has BEEN revealing the truth.. very thoroughly might I add. Take care!",@allegro_fyre_lounge,2024-03-06T04:06:47Z,2

"Red lights in Blurryface represent the bishops, but the red lights are during the song bandito. Tyler just came back from Dema, and is recovering from being brainwashed, but has been harolded a hero, and called Clancy. The brainwashing the bishops did is being taught subtly to the banditos. Far fetched theory I know. Tell me what you think. Also, he opens a door 1:34 .

Because I know now we're saying they're the same person, but something just doesn't click. Plus, well maybe i'm reading into it, but it's weird how there's tyler with the mask on and tyler without, like they're separate.
