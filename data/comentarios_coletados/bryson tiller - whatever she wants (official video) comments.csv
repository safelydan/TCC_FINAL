"Love the song but I wish the video could have matched the vibe of it. Like instead of having random fashion nova women twerking in a studio why not put some video vixens in with them driving nice cars, getting their money, shots of them walking in the city, etc like how they did in the early 2000s.

I am praying for Bryson. His songs are usually based off deep feelings. This seems like everyone moving off pain. And masking it with whor3 of Babylon and jazzebel. Money. And drugs. Even if you say you not tired. This gets old. Your spirit craves father and christ. I pray for you to come home. AMEN 🙏🏼❤️🙌🏼🙌🏼✝️,@alexistaylor7483,2024-03-21T22:08:43Z,1
