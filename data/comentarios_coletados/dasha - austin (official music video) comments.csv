Songs today are so sure and they never change it up it's just the same song for barely two and a half minutes to 2 minutes and 50 seconds.

"Not a big country guy & usually listening to reggae, but have to admit, I heard this song the other day & something made me look it up.    It’s catchy & I really like it.   Prob my only country song saved.  This is considered country music right?",@bdub3871,2024-07-02T10:18:13Z,0
To all of those joking about slim shady his name is Jaden Hossler. He is a very talented kid. I don’t know about his “punk rock” because I’m not a 14 year old emo goth anymore but his acoustic performances are amazing.,@Dudewheresmycar1234,2024-07-02T08:50:45Z,0
"Great song, super catchy, however she sounds like shit live. I saw her in Anaheim when she opened for Parker McCollum and her singing and strip tease type dance moves were not it.",@desireeeliason477,2024-12-30T19:54:09Z,0
"i  discovered your song yesterday and sincerly how tell you good job Dasha ? It's very ... (i don't have the words) the dance, the lyrics and the ideas are so gooddddd",@JemSin,2024-07-04T12:23:53Z,0
"So many lyrics I totally didn’t understand when hearing the song for the first time “Did the nurse come get you?” “Still shopping in Austin” was what I heard. I kind of love this song for all the wrong reasons, I think it’s funny. The girl sounds like she’s prob a brat and he went back to his normal stable ex. 😂 Prob proposed to his ex and they went to Vegas and got married 😂 if I was a guy I would have left her without warning too 😂",@Niccis_Narrative,2024-10-17T14:18:54Z,0

"It’s the tune of a French song called Daddy DJ by Daddy DJ that was already been reused so many times already:  Basshunter, Crazy frog, Gummibär, Black M and Milky Chance …and people are like “wow this diserves a Grammy, it’s the song of 2024.” 😂 If you find the tune so catchy, it’s because they played it at your daycare at least once when you were little. 😂",@msch7620,2025-01-03T22:17:33Z,0

My only problem with this song is that it's not long enough. I need more than two chances to scream the chorus when I'm driving with the radio turned all the up. 🥲,@irishrose90,2024-07-31T23:06:25Z,0
