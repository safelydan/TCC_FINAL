"Billie Eilish captures the intensity of devotion in 'Birds of a Feather,' turning love's fragility into something fiercely eternal. Her vocals are a beautiful reflection of the paradox of love both tender and unbreakable. The emotional weight behind this track feels like a whispered promise of forever, even in the face of inevitable goodbyes.",@LoversSymphony,2024-09-23T19:42:04Z,66
"Easily Song of the Year. First time I listened to it on the album, for me it was an instant classic. I was craving for a song like this: simple, passionate and mostly universal. Anyone can vibe, from Gen Z to Baby Boomers, reminding of their teenage love. I'm not a Billie Eilish fan, but I have to thank her for delivering what I wanted.",@org-prod,2024-09-21T01:50:32Z,34

I'm a mess, I was desperate, and I became toxic. My actions may cause you doubt with how stressful it may seem. But do know my intentions were genuine. I'm too stupid to understand what you wanted. I was afraid- I'm always afraid of losing you. And like a cornered rat, I desperately did everything I know in order to keep you. Which made you further distance yourself. My heart still beats for you, and it aches at how far you distanced yourself. I don't know what to do anymore, so now I pray to your saint, Saint Juan.

"This composition follows a simple OGWT ""tin pan alley chord progression""  - Dmaj7.....Bm7......Em7 .......A7.....(or a 1 - 6 - 2 - 5 chord progression) which is why it's so catchy and hypnotic. Similarly, sometimes the alternative format of 6 - 2 - 5 - 1 has a similar melodic structure.",@lyndamcardle4123,2024-11-20T22:09:34Z,0

I am quite late to the party but that song is unreal. Credit to Billie but mad respect to Finneas. This guy is a genuis. I mean they both are. Just watched that video how they made that song and the time and effort they poured into it.
