"Nothing beats a proper, good ol' country-rock duet. This sounds like it could have been written at any point in the last 50 years, yet somehow feels like a breath of fresh air. Wonderful.",@darryl2542,2024-04-04T07:24:18Z,1506
"People be sleeping on Miley, but I have always found her vocals to be AMAZING. And in this song, HER VOICE brings out the country tone in Beyoncé’s voice.",@mrs.rogersneighborhood,2024-03-31T18:19:00Z,525
This song feels so nostalgic. Like it’s been here for decades. Their voices blend so well and Miley keeping up with Beyonce is outstanding!! This one should take home all the Grammys!,@CosmicJournee,2024-03-30T16:32:12Z,421
Beyonces strong vocals and Miley’s raspy vocals together are everything! Together they touch the soul,@i1629,2025-02-04T01:10:54Z,276
"The more that I listen, the more  I hear Beyonce on the low notes and then soaring on the high notes ....the blending of their voice was so tight it almost goes unnoticed",@griffimj,2024-03-30T22:47:16Z,133
The vocals on this were just PURE raw and meaningful. I have no other words but to say this song was just pure perfection,@nillamcc3532,2024-04-01T17:32:50Z,125

This kind of music is the thing that really gets into my soul. Their VOCAL is everything. Really nicely harmonize. Such iconics!!!,@Focope93,2024-04-03T11:04:56Z,117
Omg their voices in harmony is suede and velvet with the texture!! WOW!!! I want a whole album of them dueting,@crabbypanda,2024-03-30T20:50:24Z,116
"Most of the complaints are just coming here from the Grammy win and people that are the loudest don't really have an ear for actual music because of their own noise. Both Beyonce and Miley compliment each other on this song, the fact that they are singing within the same octave with each bringing their uniqueness in each of their voices. Making it a true duet with each singer taking a line and then joining together for the chorus and adlibs is just musical science.",@WadeM-fp2ii,2025-02-06T00:10:58Z,78

"There is a certain peace that comes from hearing their voices blending in so well, this song makes me think of old friendships of mine, makes me wanna cry, makes wanna smile, gives me peace, it is a mix of emotions for real. This is how duets should always be. My favorite collaboration of the year. 💜",@aliceseteco122,2024-03-30T20:07:28Z,29
"This song is sublime and an instant classic.  I have always thought their voices are absolutely beautiful, and hearing them in a duet is what I needed today.  For some reason, I got emotional when I heard the lines: ""Know we're jumping the gun, but we're both still young. One day we won't be.""  Beyonce and Miley have the extraordinary ability to make you feel like they're telling your story. Kudos to both for a job well done.",@Mimi-zk9ks,2024-04-03T14:47:15Z,22
"Oh my fucking god… Beyoncé & Miley voices really blended so perfectly together. This was an unexpectedly collab ever. The Beyoncé & Miley collab we didn’t needed. Their voices / their harmonies together is absolutely so very beautiful & stronger. // Honesty, I NEVER thought in a million years that Beyoncé & Miley was gonna collab together.  This song is so extremely beautiful & incredible. This was definitely unexpectedly collab ever. The harmonies, The guitar, The vocal blend, Their voices really complimented each other. This is definitely their BEST pop / country song they have ever done together. I feel like they should do more country music together in the future. Beyoncé extremely understood the assignment when she put Miley to collaborated with her to this song. I’m so very proud of Miley because she really deserves everything & more. She worked so very hard to get to where she’s at right now. She went from Hannah Montana, (actress) to a country singer & now she’s a Grammy award winning artist.",@staciaallen3330,2024-03-30T19:21:01Z,20

"This is a song to be remembered for many occasions. I think Miley helped birth this song as one of the best songs on Beyoncès album. TBH this song should have went to Miley Cyrus and her alone,  Period. Beyonce isn't as country as she thinks she is just cuz she's from Texas,  her vocals on any of the songs I heard aren't country, it's her old R&B self BEFORE JAY-Z and that's the lane she should've ALWAYS STAYED IN. HER STRONGEST SUIT",@godzchild909,2024-04-05T04:01:08Z,5

"I have to admit that I skipped over this song often, my aunt who was my partner in crime passed away back in January after a long fight with some health issues. She came to me in a dream and this song was playing low in the dream while she was sitting there. I woke up to see if maybe I had left the tv on or if my phone was playing music but the lyrics were haunting me and I’m like this sounds familiar, when I realized what song it was it was this one.

Both artists are too big to do a duet. Both singing over one another. That's not harmony. That's ego. Country Music is not for Beyonce; she does not have the vocal commands needed to do country music fans proud. It's like asking Mariah Carey to do Country Music. Both artists were coached for any genre except country. Beyonce is SO talented... immensely talented. Leave country music to the hicks and twangers.,@barbarakosloski9260,2024-04-03T17:15:52Z,1

Is it just me or is it most difficult to figure which song is the best in this beautiful compilation of music. And no I'm a fan of no one but I do appreciate musicality and lyrical arrangement in Sonic awesomeness is just so beautiful to hear every single track in this compilation of the second act. Not certain but this song is melodically divine and the collab is on fire but what really makes every single track is that it is so well thought out and I'm not certain if younger generations who don't know history of certain musics see the mini correlations that she has done with each and every track and how it's building upon not just our history throughout music and country music in specific but she collapsed and connects the dots with other beautiful forms of folk music the lyrical content the melody content the arrangement content is just top tier and so well thought out given a history lesson along with being so currently and socially that it may miss a lot of individuals listening young or old and so kudos every time I hear a track I'm just overwhelmed with joy that I started to cry and it is so beautifulto see such spiritually mentally emotionally thought out music,@lemuelmalik8347,2024-03-31T06:09:08Z,1

Beyonce is sing way too hard too early in the song. The build-up would work with the amount of power/growling she's using. Miley is using a more neutral/mellow tone and using more power vocals towards the end. I could barely hear Miley essentially during the duet.  It's not a bad song.

I am not feeling the feels yall seem to have.  🙁 i was excited to hear their song together and idk what I expected their song to sound like but that was not it. I enjoy both of them in their respective places but this definitely wasn’t an immediate hit to me. ☹️ also definitely not “play on repeat for a week” feeling. Love the lyrics though!,@kenzyhowell5815,2024-04-21T11:03:52Z,0

Worse mistake Beyoncé has ever made was singing with Miley. It’s obvious that Mikey’s voice over powers Beyoncé’s voice. Miley’s voice and high notes makes Beyoncé voice insignificant poor Beyoncé she doing too much right now.,@cesartattoo89javier31,2024-04-04T00:17:23Z,0
It’s giving landslide (Fleetwood Mac) and butterfly fly away (Hannah Montana) vibes,@robinsanabria6483,2024-04-03T13:17:46Z,0
Ripped off the rhythm from Landslide and Miley sounds like a billy goat.,@TinyNchrome,2024-04-01T17:38:30Z,0
Not the best voices together and the mix is crowded when they sing together. One sings strong and the other is whispering. Lyrics are  silly ....Good try you two 😂,@Oklahomeboy,2024-04-04T15:37:30Z,0
"Nah, what is this nursery rhyme schlock?! Why so many ""still/not young"" lyrics, Miley, it just comes across as weird, sad & cope-y. Also ""shotgun rider"" ok, corny metaphor, ur writers couldn't come up with smt better? That melody feels so half-assed, as does the chord progression, overall the most uninspired song I've heard in a long time no lie. Pop is so trash, why did I even click this",@junkfire4554,2024-04-04T21:31:42Z,0
First of all this collab is classically iconic on top of that they giving us Stevie nicks vibes in this song and the lyrics are so beautiful have me crying and joy of the elements that are throughout this song and throughout this whole album EP whatever it's called nowadays LOL such beautiful eclectic work building upon the histories of just humanity in music and we have to recognize the collective efforts that the genius and all that she worked with put into this work. Have you noticed what she did with Jolene my goodness is it an inspiration not only does she give honor to Dolly Parton but she has her own generational spin lyrically and situationally in the song and it is awesomely done with the nuances of changing you know the vibe she's the epitome of that sort of like a song just switching up tone and Melody and feeling but then going back we have to recognize this greatness,@lemuelmalik8347,2024-03-31T06:02:26Z,0
That would’ve sound so much better if they didn’t isolate Beyoncé’s vocals so much,@whylogicalthinking,2024-04-03T17:13:26Z,0

"Voices are beautiful, harmony is great, words are so shallow and puts women in the backset or waiting on someone else to give them worth words to this song suck, if he wants to spend his time getting high until he is old honey go make yourself a better life find a better driver to ride shotgun with.

Mileys voice turns everything into gold for the ears.  I would have wanted to hear this only with Miley...or perhaps a duet between Miley and Noah. Bey is great but I miss the authenticity and calm country vibe. She always pushes a little bit to hard with excess wailing etc....,@evipevi1973,2024-03-31T23:29:12Z,0
