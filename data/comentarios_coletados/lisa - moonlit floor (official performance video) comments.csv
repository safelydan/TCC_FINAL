"Just so everyone knows, this song is an homage to the original track ""Kiss Me"" released in 1998 by the band Sixpence None the Richer. The original songwriter from the band is also credited in this track. It has the same melody but with modified lyrics. It's a nice rendition of the original",@mugglepotato,2025-01-23T04:31:04Z,19

"Not saying she's gold digging she mau truly be with the person she loves but when she says ""wasn't trying to meet anyone and she's trying to get the bag"" or whatever the full lyrics are.
