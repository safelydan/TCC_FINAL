"Just so everyone knows, this song is an homage to the original track ""Kiss Me"" released in 1998 by the band Sixpence None the Richer. The original songwriter from the band is also credited in this track. It has the same melody but with modified lyrics. It's a nice rendition of the original",@mugglepotato,2025-01-23T04:31:04Z,19

"I much like Apt. and this one compared to Mantra.  I can only watch/listen to Mantra 1x (i found it tiresome).  Personally, Apt. &  Moonlit Floor are 100x watchable and groovy. Moonlit Floor is such a sultry song and suits Lisa very much. Apt. is fun and quirky and is quite musically catchy and suits Rose.  WELL DONE Rose and Lisa!!!",@yvonnereyes9954,2024-11-03T05:59:57Z,0
