What JK has shown vocally here is top-notch, and since he achieved this effect easily and almost imperceptibly for the average listener, it seems to us that this is an easy song. The text is simple, but it contains a huge emotional message that is not lost in the multitude of words and verses. And the choreography is a real masterpiece, created together with the best dancers and choreographers. And JK danced just as great as his dancers.

"Amy Lee, of the rock band Evanescence, gave an interview last year that stuck with me, and I want to talk about it now, since people are getting both brave and showing a decided lack of comprehension. Amy spoke of being small, female, and young in rock music when Evanescence began, and that was why she was so determined to do EVERYTHING herself. It was a way to protect herself, as well as a way to control the musical output. Now, over TWO DECADES LATER, she says she doesn't have that need to ""prove herself"" anymore and works with many others on her music. Let's put this in terms of Jungkook. He recorded Golden for one reason, according to him: to show his voice/talents on different genres. He was ALREADY confident enough in his skills as a vocalist that he had producers and writers giving him songs to make the perfect album. Jungkook debuted with Golden BECAUSE he had nothing to prove EXCEPT his voice. He wanted ‚Äî he CHOSE ‚Äî to prove he was a singer and a performer. He already proved he was a writer, producer, mixer, vocal coach, vocal arranger, composer and even studio/session singer. He is already a full KOMCA member because songs he wrote are THAT successful and impactful. He proved what he could do behind the scenes. He wanted to NOW prove what a true singer he was. And that is so admirable, and so impressive, that upon his DEBUT album, he was so confident in himself that he chose songs like Standing Next to You and Somebody. That he wanted to show the world that Jeon Jung Kook is a SINGER first and foremost. So grateful to stan someone with such depth and breadth of talent, as well as such confidence.",@JeonJk-u6p,2025-02-08T19:21:34Z,10
