"I'm from Brazil and my autistic son is fascinated by music, he sings this melody all over the place. Congratulations on your success 😀",@dekajr.motoristauberguarul2798,2025-06-19T12:51:28Z,56
"I was late in discovering Mr. Swims, but now that I have I'm obsessed with his music, especially this song. IMO it's the best thing I've ever heard. The song coupled with his unbelievable voice touches places and emotions no song before ever has. And I'm 76 years old so I've heard a lot of great music in my time. Bravo, Mr. Sims. If this definitive piece of work doesn't bring you the stardom you certainly deserve, something is wrong with the ears of everyone in the world. Thank you for sharing your talent and voice with us all.",@lindagentry9468,2024-11-03T03:24:06Z,53

"🔥❤‍🔥🔥This man has the entire 100% full package in every single song he sings! His nuance, control, vocals, lyrics... lord I just can't get enough.  The first time I heard Teddy was when he sang Lose Control on the voice as a guest performer. My fiance and I didn't know who he was... WE WERE FLOORED!!! Glued to the tv and hit replay ... TWICE!  Holy crap. Who would've thought that it would be the floodgate to all things Teddy Swims ever since? I've gotten almost everything he's done so far, and I just can't turn it off. Seriously... no joke. On repeat. Everything. I heard an interview at C24, and it was cool to hear who he wanted to perform with: Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Adele! WHEN CAN WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN!?  The world needs Teddy's light.  Blessings from the great Pacific Northwest, Lakewood, Washington!  💛🖤💛    #TeddySwims",@smedina146,2024-10-04T18:59:45Z,25

"Teddy, I dont say this often. Your amazing. Your voice touchs souls and warms hearts. My dog loves you. No Joking here. My Dog Bear heard this song and as you started to sing he turned his head to the Tv and started watching  you as you sang. He Never Does This.  I could see a smile on his face and he curled up as close as he could to me and put his head on my shoulder and  gazed in my eyes. You touched his heart Teddy. It was the most amazing thing I have seen him do since my wife passed away 2 years ago.  My Bear is a 8yr old 135lb  Cane Corso and has always been a very emotional dog.  Every time I play this song he does the same thing. He loves this song and so do I. Thank you",@Grafdesgn,2024-11-27T02:04:06Z,4

"It was a cold and chilly day. The streets were white it was snowing. I entered Best Buy and I knew I had arrived to my destination. Christmas was almost here so I went to buy a Christmas present. And approached checkout and as I was waiting on line to pay for the present something unexpectedly magical happened. This song was being played on the Best Buy speakers. The volume was low and would increase out of nowhere and it would go through the roof. It was being overplayed and I just had to see who was the legend playing this song. I laid my eyes across the store only to see the one and only legend playing it. He was tall like Alex, old like Frank and Indian like Daniel. I smiled inside my head and I was looking around to see if anyone heard this legend like I heard him. His talents were amazing that I started snapping my fingers and stomping my foot automatically to the beat. In my head I was like “TURN UP THE BEAT!!!” 🐶🎧I was still there waiting for my item to arrive when all of a sudden my spirit animal blessed my ears and nose. He had just tooted right in front of me no one else in sight had heard. I could smell what had had eaten a Taco Bell burrito with beans cheese and no sour cream made by jessica at 2:27 pm.

There’s sumn about this dude that’s pure. Genuine. He carried that sing and video “somethin bout a woman” as black ppl we can see when it’s faked. When the rhythm the persona is created. This dude is thorough. This really who he is and music is just the way he express him self. It’s refreshing to see sumn honest. Someone being themselves. And him being white with so much soul is insane I can’t lie. He had to have a big up bringing with black culture. Even if not. This is pure artistry. Gotta give props when they deserve it.,@Naledgetheartistofficial,2025-01-01T08:33:06Z,0

"I am not sure if I am alright, really my emotions are all over the place one moment I am up the next i am down , sometimes i feel so empty as though there is a hole where my heart should be , just an emptiness inside me, but I tend to just say I am okay it is simpler that way nobody ever asks you to elaborate on being okay there are moments when everything feels confusing, days blend together and overthinking kills every happy moment. My mind races on to replay every moment every regret. I question whether it is all going to make sense someday if the ache will ease, right now it feels like i am lost, I look at the mirror and all I see is a stranger.",@edmondilbawi,2025-01-27T20:09:24Z,0

"The devil is knocking on your door. Yikes. You want the ""full black magic"" - you got it. Just as pride is the way to destruction so is the embracement of evil. No need to lose control when someone who you want to be w/thinks otherwise. Just accept & move on - no blaming. No excuse to say that the person has created a ""mess"" in you. Reality - you did it to yourself. The Bible tells us not to put our trust in man. No illusion or delusion... we are to be of sound mind not preconceived notions. I like the music & this artists voice is incredible but the lyrics are laughable.  Somehow when a relationship ends its okay to blame & not take responsibility for one's actions that lead to the demise. Regardless.... lets just say moving on from a relationship is not the end of the world!!! 🤔",@aletafrances4984,2024-10-19T03:03:36Z,0

This song is literally written for me by this guy who seems to know how much I suffer when I’m alone without my husband in my life.  The lyrics about the devil is so true for me banging on my door to tell me to give up.  I am struggling with the fact that I’m older now and my body aches so bad that I just want to be out of pain.  Life has gotten worse over time and I feel compelled to give up on myself because I’m such a burden to my family that I just want to die and let them live in peace and seeing each other doing great things together.

I or anyone else, with an ordinary voice, can train as much as they want, but if the voice isn't beautiful, it doesn't become beautiful, and if the vocal range is what it is, it stays that way...

"I had never heard of him until I came across a random video (I'm in the classical world). I heard some good notes and phrasing in his ""Door"" (so decided to check it out). Here, there are some good notes when he goes into a higher/louder vocal . And while I'm not particularly against the nasal style, something needs work in the lower register. I think of Joe Cocker's ""Don't let me be misunderstood,"" and his nasal delivery works, and is more shaped.

"I remember when I was listening to your covers of Mario “let me love you” “Tennessee Wisky” by Chris Stapleton, “Blinding Lights” by The Weekend. This was all 5 years ago and I knew that you would make it because you’re  Amazing and you would make it. I remember driving with my Wife across the country listening to your first album on repeat. And now your tickets at Red Rocks, Colorado are $1,000 plus just for GA. That’s ridiculous, I am disappointed that I am not in there financial position to pay for your tickets. I know all your lyrics to every song. We would love to see you, but I have to mention, sell out? Remember where you came from. You’ve taken fame too quickly my friend. Remember to stay humble and remember your roots. Hit me up if you read this message for some tickets. Your Adoring Fan.",@stephentodesco3788,2025-03-06T21:40:26Z,0
