"I was late in discovering Mr. Swims, but now that I have I'm obsessed with his music, especially this song. IMO it's the best thing I've ever heard. The song coupled with his unbelievable voice touches places and emotions no song before ever has. And I'm 76 years old so I've heard a lot of great music in my time. Bravo, Mr. Sims. If this definitive piece of work doesn't bring you the stardom you certainly deserve, something is wrong with the ears of everyone in the world. Thank you for sharing your talent and voice with us all.",@lindagentry9468,2024-11-03T03:24:06Z,53

"üî•‚ù§‚Äçüî•üî•This man has the entire 100% full package in every single song he sings! His nuance, control, vocals, lyrics... lord I just can't get enough.  The first time I heard Teddy was when he sang Lose Control on the voice as a guest performer. My fiance and I didn't know who he was... WE WERE FLOORED!!! Glued to the tv and hit replay ... TWICE!  Holy crap. Who would've thought that it would be the floodgate to all things Teddy Swims ever since? I've gotten almost everything he's done so far, and I just can't turn it off. Seriously... no joke. On repeat. Everything. I heard an interview at C24, and it was cool to hear who he wanted to perform with: Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Adele! WHEN CAN WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN!?  The world needs Teddy's light.  Blessings from the great Pacific Northwest, Lakewood, Washington!  üíõüñ§üíõ    #TeddySwims",@smedina146,2024-10-04T18:59:45Z,25

I could see a smile on his face and he curled up as close as he could to me and put his head on my shoulder and  gazed in my eyes. You touched his heart Teddy. It was the most amazing thing I have seen him do since my wife passed away 2 years ago.  My Bear is a 8yr old 135lb  Cane Corso and has always been a very emotional dog.

"It was a cold and chilly day. The streets were white it was snowing. I entered Best Buy and I knew I had arrived to my destination. Christmas was almost here so I went to buy a Christmas present. And approached checkout and as I was waiting on line to pay for the present something unexpectedly magical happened. This song was being played on the Best Buy speakers. The volume was low and would increase out of nowhere and it would go through the roof. It was being overplayed and I just had to see who was the legend playing this song. I laid my eyes across the store only to see the one and only legend playing it. He was tall like Alex, old like Frank and Indian like Daniel. I smiled inside my head and I was looking around to see if anyone heard this legend like I heard him. His talents were amazing that I started snapping my fingers and stomping my foot automatically to the beat. In my head I was like ‚ÄúTURN UP THE BEAT!!!‚Äù üê∂üéßI was still there waiting for my item to arrive when all of a sudden my spirit animal blessed my ears and nose.

"The devil is knocking on your door. Yikes. You want the ""full black magic"" - you got it. Just as pride is the way to destruction so is the embracement of evil. No need to lose control when someone who you want to be w/thinks otherwise. Just accept & move on - no blaming. No excuse to say that the person has created a ""mess"" in you. Reality - you did it to yourself. The Bible tells us not to put our trust in man. No illusion or delusion... we are to be of sound mind not preconceived notions. I like the music & this artists voice is incredible but the lyrics are laughable.  Somehow when a relationship ends its okay to blame & not take responsibility for one's actions that lead to the demise.

"I had never heard of him until I came across a random video (I'm in the classical world). I heard some good notes and phrasing in his ""Door"" (so decided to check it out). Here, there are some good notes when he goes into a higher/louder vocal . And while I'm not particularly against the nasal style, something needs work in the lower register. I think of Joe Cocker's ""Don't let me be misunderstood,"" and his nasal delivery works, and is more shaped.

"Sorry, but I come from a different era and the song,"" The Door,"" would be a BIG Hit in my time . Lose Control Im afraid to say wouldn't even crack the top 500 if not 1000. It just doesn‚Äôt grab one like the door does. The door has that it factor, as ABBA says, "" hooks"", to draw you into the rhythm melody of the song. My era ? The early 60s up to the late 80s. But really 1971.",@charlesalexanderhewison7817,2025-04-15T10:54:38Z,0

"I remember when I was listening to your covers of Mario ‚Äúlet me love you‚Äù ‚ÄúTennessee Wisky‚Äù by Chris Stapleton, ‚ÄúBlinding Lights‚Äù by The Weekend. This was all 5 years ago and I knew that you would make it because you‚Äôre  Amazing and you would make it. I remember driving with my Wife across the country listening to your first album on repeat. And now your tickets at Red Rocks, Colorado are $1,000 plus just for GA. That‚Äôs ridiculous, I am disappointed that I am not in there financial position to pay for your tickets. I know all your lyrics to every song. We would love to see you, but I have to mention, sell out? Remember where you came from. You‚Äôve taken fame too quickly my friend.
