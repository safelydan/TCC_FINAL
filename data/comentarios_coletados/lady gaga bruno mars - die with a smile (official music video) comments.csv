"Die With A Smile: A Legacy of Joy This phrase, ""Die With A Smile,"" speaks volumes about approaching life's end with peace and acceptance. It's not about denying pain or hardship, but rather about cultivating a life where the positive memories and relationships outweigh the negativity. It encourages us to find joy in the present moment, cherish loved ones, and live a life aligned with our values, so that when the time comes, we can depart with a sense of contentment and a smile on our face. It's a reminder to live fully, love deeply, and leave a legacy of joy.",@ammarabrahem1151,2025-08-22T05:36:58Z,0

"Recently, I had a dream of my sister, who passed away in November of 2024 . I watched her walk into a house where we had a gathering, and my mind was telling me how.  She couldn't be here knowing that she had passed already . And I immediately started to cry and she looked at me and told me everything was ok and not to cry .I was crying so hard that I woke myself up and I was still crying . Then, as I was leaving for work the this song played, and listening to the 1st verse hit me so hard.  I love you Lena , I miss you more than ever . Until we meet again +❤+❤+❤+",@MichaelHerrera-e5e,2025-07-16T04:57:39Z,0

Bruno is the Paul McCartney John Lennon and Brian Wilson all into one in today’s world of ever changing music . Heart soul meaning and emotion with absolute perfect vocals and harmonies unlike any other in the last decades or so and Gaga well what can you say she’s sensational and owns the stage . Beautiful song,@gregcomeaux8105,2025-08-09T02:29:10Z,0
