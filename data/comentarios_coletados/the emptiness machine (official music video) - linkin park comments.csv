"To be honest, I am actually very attached to the ""old"" Linkin Park, but now, for what happened we are talking about history. In any case, the new singer, Emily, in my opinion identifies a new direction for the band; reborn after her arrival. Her tones and her grit are very reminiscent of Chester, in fact in many expressions she emphasizes them. Compared to an animal, she would be a lioness. The band now has to focus on the new direction, unfortunately the old songs, especially those from the first albums, before Emily, sound decidedly strange. Good luck to the new Linkin Park! I am and will always be with them.",@andsani,2025-03-30T20:46:37Z,3

"sometimes if you have a date with your boyfriend, don't tell strangers about it, because when Satan hears about the date, he will disguise himself as your boyfriend and come to the place you have plannedaddition, sometimes we fought to make things difficult for each other.Girls, be careful,In addition, Satan is power-mad and claims to be the master. He is very greedy and loves to drink and be drunk. Satan is very lowly. There is very bad news for young people.The message is that Satan can change into human form.With that power from the Creator, Satan sometimes changes into a form and interferes between lovers, husbands and wives, and friendsIn addition to tormenting the Creator daily using various methods of torture, Satan was very cruel to the Creator, even demanding that the Creator serve himSatan also restricted the Creator by saying that man must love him and not only him, but he must be loyal to him. He also threatened that if man is not loyal to man, he will cause trouble to man if he has love and loyalty towards himSatan had previously kidnapped man and demanded that the Creator give him all of his power and authority if he wanted him aliveAfter gaining power and authority, Satan not only captured the Creator and imprisoned him, but also poisoned the human spirit by misusing the power he received from the CreatorIf you sometimes listen to the words of the Creator with all your heart, you will feel the breath of love.However, Satan has a sword at the back of the Creator and your back, allowing you to say only what the Creator tells you to say, and not what the Creator wants you to say.When the Creator wants to come to you, He sometimes changes the form of someone (your mother, father, lover, friend, wife) and comes to youThe true body of the Creator is locked up in a prison by Satan, and if you speak too much when you meet him or say that he has been arrested, he will not only beat him to death, but also harm you.The Creator cannot show off his wisdom whenever he wants because he is threatened with human life. Satan has forced the Creator to live a life no different from an animal.The Creator needs the help of mankind now. He has been captured. If you want to hear His voice, look for the book The Return of Jesus.The Creator God is being held captive by Satan and is being tortured by Satan every day.

"Im right after Opener festival in Poland and daamn i didnt expect my fav band still exists.. i didnt even think its posssible to find some to replace Chester and true but Emily is not a there for a replacement shes there for a new chapter and I love it. I love the old sound of LP and what they added to their music, I love their look and love Emily. I could see that shes not feelin comfortable performing the old LM songs and still not showing charisma but that last thing gonna change soon im sure. There where a lot od parts revealing the potential that made me belive its gonna be at the SAME level as with Chester(not afraid to say this)!

If you wanted to continue making music you guys should have made a new band, because allowing this, actually besmirches chesters name and ruins the chemistry he formed with his fans for years! This is not linkin park, this doesnt sound like linkin park! There is no reason she deserves to step into a position already paved for fame! She hasnt proved herself at all, she is not deserving to take chesters place, no one is! And i must say this continuing ruins my future as a linkin park fan!",@lokiduus6490,2025-06-08T02:48:28Z,0
"If she weren't Mike's close friend, and if she were merely auditioning for the lead vocals as an outsider (like they did with Rockstar INXS), she wouldn't even make it to Top-3.
