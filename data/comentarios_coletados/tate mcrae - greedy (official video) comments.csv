"*You can tell that the guy with the violet fro is a whole ass pro-violence/anti-peace sociopath. Rolls his eyes at people and for what reason? Dramatic purposes. He's not trapped. Nobody's destroying his dignity or violating his rights. He rolls his eyes just to bother. Like, annoying as shit. It's written on his face and mannerisms! Likes heated situations and violence for no reason whatsoever. Animalistic. Not smart. Like, these ain't Gaga's backup dancers. This shit reeks of TRASH gay drama. Now, THIS is the arrogance I speak up about. It's so dumb. And no, I'm not saying that you're not allowed to be unique, I'm telling you to actually be yourself and quit this TRASH drama.*",@earlaweese,2024-05-17T01:48:45Z,0

"The song is so bad in the sense that the verse basically has only two notes. It's like a monotone verse. The chorus is at least listenable, but there isn't much to the chorus either.

"What I thought at the time and now reinforced a year later, A one-hit wonder with far too much flash and attitude, lacking the substance to back it up. While the track itself is decent, the video is poorly executed. The lyrics come across as narcissistic and self-indulgent rather than genuinely empowering or celebrating self-love. Instead of inspiring, the “me, me, me” tone feels grating. The dressing and choreography fall flat, and her lack of classical beauty or elegance makes this kind of arrogance even harder to pull off convincingly.",@vamseemk,2025-01-17T01:02:34Z,0

I kind of don’t get why people say she isn’t unique. Her songs all break the pop writing formula and it works better imo and she knows how to keep a songs energy throughout the whole thing.
