"Back in the 80s ASU and Tempe were very conservative.  I returned for a PhD in 2021 as an old Gen X guy.  The place has gone far left and woke for politics relative to the 80s.  This song reminds me of the modern youth culture in Tempe - very woke with blurred sexual identities across the progressive ""rainbow"" spectrum.  As a moderately conservative Catholic, I am fully aware I am an old guy out-of-place with that scene.  So, I just walk around campus as if HR has a drone flying over me and focus on my dissertation and courses.  But that song really hits the campus vibe these days - a far cry from the 80s with duets like Olivia Newton John and Cliff Richard in ""Suddenly"".",@manuelsteele7755,2024-09-27T16:53:45Z,1

That said it all but ppl still don’t have a clue. They just enjoy the circus while these ppl just get to be rich and famous and have secret dark rituals at home that need to be performed to stay at the top 🤡 kidnapping and sexyally abusing small kids is just a small part of it.
