"I'm a 38 year old metalhead who ONLY really listens to progressive, djent, and experimental metal genres, but I gotta say, I'm fr diggin this song. I love the 80s and 90s synths and percussions. It's truly a vibe. Def a guilty pleasure!",@AboutFalling,2024-09-27T05:06:33Z,1531
"This song is actually phenomenal. I'm mind blown how people write songs like these. The word play, beat and rhythm. Actual masterpiece. I listen to a lot of metalcore, post hardcore, pop punk but pop music has their really outstanding shining moments.",@krilaz,2025-02-08T18:33:08Z,1434
"""Bed Chem"" is the one that transcends 5 decades of music. 80s vibe of 90s hit, ""Into You,"" with the mid 2020 melody!",@ImLVLegitcusImthasht,2024-10-10T12:01:44Z,483

My favorite part of the song is near the end when Sabrina sings those 90's sounding keyboard notes. Girl make more songs like this because my 1990 born self loves it!,@danielletopping2763,2025-02-07T14:53:34Z,107

Worst song ever.,@assassin77FTW,2024-10-29T20:07:53Z,3
"Sabrina should really switch lanes  to R&B. This is tha only song I can tolerate of hers. Espresso sounds just like Flowers by Miley or Happy by Pharrell. Over commercialized pop garbage. But Bed Chem has like early 2000’s/late 90’s R&B vibes. Plus, with her making music like this, she REALLY shouldn’t be gearing her other songs towards tweens and lil girls. I saw her concert footage. Looked like a strip club.",@YaMutha435,2025-02-17T19:10:59Z,2
