"Happy 1st Anniversary to Not Like Us. I can't believe it's been a full year already for the songs release, I remember when this said 1 hour ago. Spring and Summer 2024 was peak, but Summer 2023 was better. The summer vibe and chorus goes so hard, the vibe goes hard. 1 year since this went off the charts along with Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter and Brat Summer, and many other songs during Summer 2024. I'm already nostalgic for 2024, so much good happened. This year really sucks horribly with the plane crashes, the stock markets, everything, basically. I know I shouldn't be getting nostalgic for 2024, but that was my year getting out depression from Late Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, so I do miss 2022 - 2024 a lot. This year hasn't been hitting in this crazy country and world we live in. Too many bad things are happening! I wanna go back so bad! May 4, 2024 - May 4, 2025 / May 5, 2024 - May 5, 2025.",@matthewmichel6508,2025-05-06T00:30:26Z,29

"What I never noticed until recently, the song he samples and the particular portion of song has lyrics that says “I believe it, I believe it!”.

I mean 'whooo' clowing on the OWL, he a ballboy, a pedophile, multiple references, back to back, standup for PAC, called him a colonizer, called out his songs God's Plan and Family Matters, he a FAN, fake as nigger, telling people to run for their lives, Sweet Chin music (Shawn Micheals finish move on canadian Brett Heart)..JUST WOW",@ericneuharth3463,2025-07-31T15:47:04Z,8
