21 gets the craziest beats. Sheesh this instrumental is straight RedRum,@andrewsmith3257,2024-05-15T05:57:26Z,1229
This beat with this Brazilian baseline is stuck in my head!!! What a track!!!!!,@ETDEVARGINHA77,2024-05-18T11:09:12Z,576
"21 savage, this album has single handedly cured my dads cancer, got rid of my mums drinking addiction, made me a better person, this album was such a masterpiece when i first listened to “nee-nah” i cried with how amazing travis and your verses were, 21 savage, thank you so much for making my life better by dropping this madterpiece of an album.",@pringlwee,2025-01-10T09:43:30Z,259
"Redrum is straight-up sinister. 21 Savage glides over the eerie beat with his cold, calculated flow—no wasted words, just straight pressure. This one feels like a warning, like he’s talking straight to his opps. Dark, raw, and relentless. Classic 21",@ThroneAsphalt-420,2025-02-21T07:03:10Z,220
"Did you know 'redrum' spelled backward is 'murder'? The song they sampled is a Brazilian classic, Serenata do Adeus by the legendary composer Vinícius de Moraes. What's crazy is that they chopped it right on 'Adeus!' which means 'Goodbye!' adding even more intensity to the vibe. 'redrum' is also taken from the movie The Shining, where you can hear 'Johnny' played by Jack Nicholson, along with the huff and puff part at the end of the song.",@abnethussien9288,2025-07-11T15:10:29Z,178
"The amount of effects and the production team are worthy of an oscar, the editing is crazy and the time it probably took to record this whole videoclip is what gives us this masterpiece by 21",@iancofreramirez5237,2024-11-07T08:46:09Z,122

"Ugh.  I’m sorry, but half of the words you’re actually trying to rhyme. Don’t rhyme. It’s not catchy. Literally sounds like just talking. You’ll just rhyme “man”with “man” in the next sentence.
