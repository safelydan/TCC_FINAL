"An interesting song with  and surprising for me, Sabrina keeps serving confidence, charm, and iconic vibes. Taste is cheeky, clever, and absolutely addictive. She really said you‚Äôll just have to taste me‚Äô and made it sound like pure pop gold. Queen behavior.",@butferwarebnd,2025-06-07T04:32:20Z,11
"This video was inspired by and pays homage to the movie ""Death Becomes Her"" a fun 80's classic you'll love which stars Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep, & Bruce Willis. This video is basically a short version remake of the film that uses all the same gags, storyline, setups/pay offs, and digital effects. ""Death Becomes Her"" is one of my absolute favorite movies from the 80's which I've seen hundreds of times thru years, and Sabrina did such an amazing job recreating it here in this masterpiece! The only difference between the two is Goldie and Meryl don't have a kissing scene.  You guys have to now see ""Death Becomes Her."" Trust me, you'll love it and you'll thank Sabrina Carpenter for showing it some love, because it's such an underrated romance horror classic.",@QuincyDisneyVegan,2025-01-05T12:42:35Z,10

"There are songs whose meaning is better left unexplored. I thought this song was about a romantic story, but Sabrina's voice is so sweet.

"Emblematic of contemporary times ‚Äî someone comes up with a passably decent song , albeit with questionable lyrics, and then produces a really horrible video for it.  Sure, the excuse will be that it‚Äôs done for laughs and is too comical to be taken seriously and no, it‚Äôs not serious, nor should it be taken that way, but if this is what constitutes lighthearted today.

"Hot take: not every powerful, badass woman who doesn't need a man is lesbian. In fact, the idea that they're lovers totally takes away from the actual story. It makes so much more sense and makes both characters cooler if they come out of the mess realizing that NEITHER of them need validation from a romantic relationship, and they become good friends because of their similar views. The last few seconds with the playful banter really confirms this: they both found a friend in each other, and they were willing to forgive each other for the beef between them. Not everything is LGBTQ.",@Captain_Chi-town,2025-06-18T02:45:02Z,2

I would not like to take part in that.

The line ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissin‚Äô you‚Äù expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex‚Äôs life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence!

I HATED this songs lyrics..was hoping there would be some type of story behind it to make me feel better so I could enjoy the song without feeling rage for a flagrant side-b.  was gonna check genius.. but  links from Reddit popped up with other people being miffed. .. someone suggested checking out the video.   Now I'm happy I did.  Cheating without remorse--.bad.   fighting over cheater-bad.   mutilation and gore. Ahh yes .. perfect.üëå.. as long as everyone's immortal.
