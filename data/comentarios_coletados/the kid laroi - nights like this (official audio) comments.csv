"Eu faço parte de um grupo de amigos na escola. Ano passado, eu me apaixonei por um menino desse grupo. Ele é aquele menino que faz graça pra todos rirem e quando o clima está pesado ele sempre tenta descontrair. Ele já tinha dado sinais que gostava de mim, só que eu não tinha interesse, até que um dia eu comecei a notar um sentimento e conversei com outros amigos do grupo. Eles ficaram super chocados, mas me incentivaram a tentar algo. Depois de uma boa ajuda deles e uns verdes a gente começou a ficar. Era tudo incrível, ele me mostrou um lado que ninguém tinha visto, e eu me sentia muito bem com isso. Depois que nós começamos a namorar, tudo mudou, aquela pessoa que eu imaginei que seria não era. Uma pessoa que passou por muitas coisas na vida e que claramente tem sequelas com isso tudo. Depois de cinco meses de namoro eu resolvi ter uma conversa séria com ele. Já não aguentava mais aquele relacionamento morto, doía muito em mim não ter ele do jeito que eu queria. Terminamos e eu sinto muita falta dele, toda vez que ouço essa música lembro de nós. Sentados do lado do outro cheio de vergonha na sala de aula, ou sentados no sofá na casa do nosso amigo. Eu amo demais ele, muito mesmo, mas infelizmente não podemos ficar juntos. Ouvir essa música me trás exatamente a ânsia de amor que eu tinha/tenho por ele.",@eduardakohut,2025-06-01T02:32:37Z,2
