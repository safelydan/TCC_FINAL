first time listening to this on Yt I'm late as fuck but Idc This is a W Album And in my opinion this Has to be the my top 1 out of 5. true story is So good but this song just hits Different then we have Yes and Which is My top 2 true story bc true story is one of those songs that hit different but you have other Options then we have Yes And at 3 Bc look Yes and Is A W but Thats and type of song To be a bop and yes Its in my top 3 bc of it plus this era of ariana on that song Is just Ariana grande the angel then we have Bye and Don't wanna break your heart These Two songs are hard to Relate Bc she talks about her past relationship in one of the and the other one is just about her leaving Someone Which can also mean the same thing but i think Bye has to be 4 for me bc Its catchy so Is Dont wanna break your heart but something about bye just hits me in a way That Dont wanna break your heart doesn't and Dont wanna break your heart is the last one I put this one in last bc i can relate to what shes saying but I hear it and I wanna like Get into a Depression stage bc of all the Things I had in a relationship But it's a good song In my opinion Love you ariana this is just my opinion 💗💗💗💗💗💗,@demontimemfs999_YT,2024-04-28T05:50:10Z,1
