"The pregnant woman symbolizes creation, transformation, and the emotional weight The Weeknd carries. She represents his struggle for rebirth or new beginnings, reflecting his inner conflict with fame and the consequences of his past. The surreal and disorienting imagery adds to the idea that while there’s potential for change, it’s unclear whether it’s positive or negative.",@ahmediscoful,2025-02-02T04:55:35Z,91

That's what I feel like Abel was doing here, because it definitely leaves a unpleasant memory for the viewer, something that will stick in their mind, something shocking and unpleasant. The reaction of which is the entire purpose of art, I feel it's purpose will be made clear to each individual later in life, as they watch this video back.
