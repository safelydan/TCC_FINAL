"I swear Tyler is a genius, this album is going to be the most influential rap album this year, i think this might even bring the art back to hip-hop and fix it, the fact that Tyler only dropped half and he whispers it forces you to listen to it multiple times to actually understand the lyrics, this is one of those times where i wish i could shake an artists hand, i appreciate this so much.",@S1arLite,2024-10-18T23:49:50Z,272

"In the full release of the song the harmony plays twice, once at half strength and then another that is equal to the one time it plays here. The harmony in this song is LITTERALLY my favorite part of the entire album so WHY on earth was there weaker version of the harmony before the full strength one it takes out so much of the just punch that it has here. Literally why how did you make a song better in a music video than normal release",@rocket-rakun8133,2024-10-29T22:35:34Z,5

A couple weeks ago I was in my computing class sitting next to my friend. 4 some reason I started to sing this song quietly in my mind but then my friend also started to sing along and we were getting louder and louder and we even started to hit our legs on the floor to the beat.

"The emotions that Tyler‚Äôs song bring , is different",@pullthesmoke,2024-10-23T06:40:01Z,2
"I believe that Tyler's new character is called Chroma The Great. This is because in the movie, The Phantom Toolbooth, Chroma the great is a character whos main job is to conduct sunlight, sunset and sunrise, which all has one main theme: Colour. My theory is that Chroma The Great (Tyler) is leading his soldiers into this crate which he exploded because the soldiers death (at least in this universe/trailer) creates colour. Thats why Chroma The Great exploded the crate. The soldiers deaths create colour. Also not sure about this last bit, but maybe why the last guy is slightly behind all of the soldiers and is not in unity is because he possibly wants to revolt against Chroma The Great. Once again, just a theory.",@stchroma1,2024-10-18T15:44:07Z,2

"Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, the production quality and music quality; godsend. But can we appreciate the unconventional, uncomfortable feeling St. Chroma‚Äôs (as in the Tyler persona) entire existence gives, he‚Äôs dressed from the neck down on a suit and dress shoes, but is wearing a creepy smooth, uncanny valley mask. And the way he walks, oh my Earfquake the way he walks; it starts as a passionate, determined march accompanied with the powerful whispering; devolving into odd, boogeyman-like strides, adding to how unnerving it is.

"One day, you wake up and recognize the need for a new Tyler, The Creator album ‚Äî not merely as music, but as a source of inspiration across multiple facets of life. His work defies predictability, offering profound insights even in tracks crafted for mainstream appeal.

It‚Äôs inevitable that his oeuvre will soon be studied in academic contexts‚Äîspanning music theory, poetry, philosophy, contemporary art, visual identity, art direction, and cinematography.",@baba123776,2024-10-23T06:49:51Z,1
