"…why would y’all change the higher breathy vocals at the “i’ll be better on saturn, none of this matters” part 😭😭😭😭 the mastercard performance was sm more ethereal :(",@alolaninetales,2024-02-23T00:23:20Z,3388
"I don’t know if anyone will ever see this, but i feel like this is a good place to talk. This song is one of the most meaningful ones to me. I feel like it really describes my life. I always stick tot he people that don’t really care about me that much, and I always wonder why I’m still there. But I know it’s because of my fear of losing everyone, so I just want to find someone who cares about me. The lyrics ‘I’ll be better on Saturn, none of this matters, dreaming of Saturn’ reminds me of how I’m dreaming of finding someone that understands me, so I’m just waiting for that day. Thank you Sza, this song is one of the best💗💗💗",@hello.poppydiy,2024-05-25T13:33:39Z,537

"The sweet and ethereal sound of her singing is discordant with the deeply Satanic nihilism embedded in the lyrics. This song presents the idea that life on earth is terrible, meaningless and cruel, and that the only dream to escape it is Luciferianism (Saturn represents Satan in the occult). A message that will lead people to Hell",@TravelLoverForLife,2024-03-29T19:55:28Z,3
"what a beautiful song with that deep, enigmatic feel of nostalgia.  I've been aware of her for quite some time, but just now starting to appreciate the breadth and feel of her art as a whole. Sza is my new celebrity crush...I adore her. Whether she's thick or thin, her unique smile , with those beautiful lush lips, shines thru like no other.  And this song takes me to somewhere else, somewhere only in a dream, can the feeling be understood. 😍🎶 ❤",@joshgooley1492,2025-07-02T02:18:14Z,3

"It subtly interpolates the opening hook of the Bee Gee’s “Too Much Heaven”. It’s in the background at small breaks, hummed as a melody by either her backing vocals or her own vocals backing her. Recognized it immediately. They’re not credited. Wondering if that was oversight, or it’s not considered an outright sample….",@i.quintanilla,2024-04-30T00:01:56Z,3

"Nikola Tesla said “If you only understood the significance of the numbers 3,6,9 you would have the keys to understanding the universe” Earth is the 3rd planet in distance from the sun, Saturn is the 6th, and Pluto is the 9th. Can someone please help me understand how can I use this information to enhance and enrich my earthly existence the way this song enhances my emotional state? Before I move onto other realms I want the absolute best of this one, is that too much to ask for? I want to increase my “goodness threshold” but I need material wealth to do so. The goodness threshold is how good can things get for you before you sabotage it by your own thoughts that this is too good to be true so a tragedy must be looming the horizons. How good can this song be before I hate it for being so good? Please help me understand🥹",@kaseymarcelle007,2024-11-03T17:59:02Z,1

"Okay, here is the story. SZA is the real deal as a singer, not sure if you write your songs and music but i would say lyrics would be your forte. This style suits you (even if it borrows from the Bee Gees). You are about the only refreshing popular artist that has a sound all to yourself. I listen to thousand of songs each year from the complete unknown to the top (payola) artists with all their backing and not many put out good songs, certainly not consistently like you SZA.

I can’t be the only one trying hard to like this version. The unreleased version just had a more magical feel to it. She also changed the lyrics from “I can’t break this pattern” to “Got to break this pattern”. The high pitched “I’ll be better on Saturn” was changed as well and the “wooh oh” before”life’s better on Saturn” on the second verse.,@WayZenNi5,2024-02-24T16:52:53Z,0

Oh no!!!!! That's why she won that Grammy she's clearly talking about satan yes the devil...saturn has a deeper meaning than just the planet...I'm hating here go look it up...do your research and you'll find the meaning...the lyrics just spooked me,@RumbidzayiChigiji,2025-03-23T11:06:31Z,0
