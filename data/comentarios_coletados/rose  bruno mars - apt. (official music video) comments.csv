"!!!ATTENTION!!! We’re standing at the edge of history. If APT hits 2 billion streams on both Spotify and YouTube, ROSÉ will enter a league reserved for the most iconic artists in the world and possibly become the first K-pop female soloist to ever do it.

"“‘Apt.’ is a colorful hit by Rosé and Bruno Mars — a high-energy, pop-punk tune with an addictive ‘apateu’ chorus. Rosé’s voice on this song exudes both a soft femininity and a strong inner strength, especially when harmonizing with Bruno Mars — creating a fresh and confident feeling. Rosie’s album really has an impressive opening!”🫶❤️❤️‍🔥😭",@Ngbao_02,2025-07-08T14:38:46Z,6

"K  it may be true that Brother Mars contributed some, but it was rosé who wrote lyrics and composed music. rosé auditioned three songs for Brother Mars, and Brother Mars said that apt was very good, so they cooperated. This song is on the top of all the music of Brother Mars. I don't want to see anyone say that it's all up to Brother Mars or something. rosé is worth it.And numberones Don't be brainwashed by haters😅Rosé has made great contributions, and it is not necessarily so popular for another person to cooperate with Brother Mars, such as his cooperation with ladygaga.😅😂R totally deserves everything",@giverosie_fiveroses,2025-08-14T13:42:42Z,5

There are thousands of artists out there writing meaningful songs daily but just can’t blow up but the korean sl*t can? I mean 2b views and 2b streams in under a year is hella overrated for as meaningless as this. Only 10 year old girls listen to this on repeat. Like bro.

Probably one of the worst songs Bruno has ever thought of starring in. Used to be my fave artist until he started doing this. Like wow what is this song about anyway. Noone knows what and APT is and it's not even a word. Crazy how these artists have really shown how much brain functionality they lost since Biden became president.,@jonathonboyd3312,2025-08-06T16:40:04Z,0
