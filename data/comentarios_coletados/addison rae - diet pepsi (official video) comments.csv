"I'll be honest, I had no clue who Addison Rae was.  But when I heard this, all I thought was, it's got a great hook, and it contained not only a bridge (quite rare in today's pop music) but also a key change, also rare.  And it was a downward modulation at that, which is novel.  Artistically, this was also the same moment when the video switched to color.  I'm pretty sure the creators of this video might've had some David Lynch on their mind with the oldies vibe and flash frame editing, along with some Americana.  I'm quite impressed.",@Starks2510,2025-08-08T03:43:06Z,5

"Sorry, but this is the worst recording quality I've ever heard, especially the muffled vocals.  Were they going for a Dreamlike effect ? They should of used another effect besides no high frequency, ridiculous amounts of reverb and compression. It completely ruins it for me, but apparently liked by many, or they just don't care about the sound quality.",@strangebrutoo,2025-06-07T21:38:21Z,0
