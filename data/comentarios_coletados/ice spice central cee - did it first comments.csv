Okay yes the lyrics aren't at all groundbreaking but shit they are both riding the beat especially Central Cee (which makes sense because this is more of a UK hip hop beat) . Listen to the beat alone and you kinda miss the vibe they both bring. You aren't meant to get inspired just bob your head around shake your ass and keep it moving. Not every song needs to be about serious thought provoking stuff gosh. Shake you ass and relax. Honestly the only song of hers I enjoy and have on repeat.,@thandeka9454,2024-10-07T16:44:38Z,1

Any real artist would say that isn't how you should be making your fame, although I'm not one to hate because she's getting her money, but its still bad. Why do I listen to her thoughh?
