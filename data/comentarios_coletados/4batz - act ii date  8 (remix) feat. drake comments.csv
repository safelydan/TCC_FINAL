Hope this young man doesn't get corrupted / watered down by the industry he has a very promising vibe that we need!!

drake has more bars on this remix than all of 4batz snippets put together. the 1:48 of autotune already started to get stale. Hopefully he has some full songs together. I want to see him have more than the 15 min.,@traviswarren6958,2024-03-30T10:04:47Z,8

Drake ruined this song no joke. Fr he did not catch this vibe or beat. He came on like “yo im drake this what I have to say this yo opportunity you don’t even have to pray just listen to me n get paid” type shit. Like bro went into full fake it mode. Cool he gave this artist a shot but this is a half hearted effort by drake who’s way better than this. His r&b flows on his older music destroy this shit he threw together. Get in your bag. Complacency destroys ambition. Just cause u made it doesn’t mean stop elevating.,@No_Zzzom,2024-03-14T18:08:22Z,1
