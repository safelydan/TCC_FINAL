"ARIANA GRANDE NEVER DISAPPOINTS US BY RELEASING GOOD MUSIC. Eternal Sunshine is really her BEST personally album she has ever released. I’m so very happy & grateful that she’s sharing her story with us ! I’m so very happy & glad she’s finally showing us a whole new different side of her too. She really did not fucking come to play this year ! I just finished listening to this album with different songs in it & all I have to say is her harmonies, her vocals, her voice, the production is absolutely unmatched ! ari really ATE & left NO crumbs with this beautiful & special & healing body of work / masterpiece. Her whole discography is the reason why i’m alive & this whole new album is absolutely so beautiful, so well done  , so powerful, so emotional, so special, so deep, so heartbreaking, so raw & so authentic. i’m so so so so incredibly proud & impressive with Ariana’s ability, her versatility, her art & her visuals. These songs / These lyrics really made me cry. This woman is definitely the MOST strongest & bravest woman alive. I love you so very much Ariana. This album is really going to change my entire life forever. ♾️☀️❤️‍🩹🥹😭",@staciaallen3330,2024-03-08T05:08:39Z,812
I love all the beats on this album they’re so different but all beautiful. I can feel ari fall in love with music again on this album,@taylorsuarez_,2024-03-08T05:34:24Z,396
The breathy coos / whisper like vocals in the background throughout the song  are so beautiful. She's the queen of vocal layering/stacking. They give such a beautiful feel to the song.,@GeeYhan,2024-03-09T16:50:46Z,230
"This is one of the most beautifully melancholic songs I have ever heard. After experiencing this period of post-breakup uncertainty where you feel like you can wait on the person who hurt you to change but deep down knowing that you’re going to have to rely on yourself to find closure and peace, this song holds such a special place in my heart. I think it’s my new favorite song by her 💜",@calebveitch17,2024-03-08T13:40:47Z,157

"Everyone interprets this song differenently, but I think it's her response to the media. How she's been misunderstood, feeling alone, exposed. It's been an rollercoaster ride for with where she's sometimes loved or hated depending on what's on the paper. It's a very emotional song.",@Travelstylechic,2024-03-29T02:36:43Z,16

"I initially thought this was about a romantic relationship. Looking into the lyrics, I think this is about the relationship between Ariana & media/press/fans (possibly surrounding the rumours she wrecked a marriage). 'You cling to your paper & pens' = waiting to write an article. 'Wait until you like me again' = when the angle changes and she is revered again by the press.  'Me & my truth we sit in silence' = Not addressing the rumours. 'Know that you made me' = the press and fans made her the success she is. 'I'm not how you paint me' = how she is depicted in the media.",@ColinnOk,2024-10-21T22:20:48Z,5
"For some reason, I don’t relate to this song romantically. It’s almost as though I’m singing it out to my 17 year old self & asking her to forgive me for everything I put her through. I’ve  always been devoted to pouring my feelings out in a journal.. the lyrics “you cling to your papers and pens. wait until you like me again. ” Really touched me.

we can't be friends (wait for your love) is a song that perfectly describes the ins and outs of falling deeply in love with someone.
