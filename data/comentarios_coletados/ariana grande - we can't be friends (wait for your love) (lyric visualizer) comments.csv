"ARIANA GRANDE NEVER DISAPPOINTS US BY RELEASING GOOD MUSIC. Eternal Sunshine is really her BEST personally album she has ever released. I‚Äôm so very happy & grateful that she‚Äôs sharing her story with us ! I‚Äôm so very happy & glad she‚Äôs finally showing us a whole new different side of her too. She really did not fucking come to play this year ! I just finished listening to this album with different songs in it & all I have to say is her harmonies, her vocals, her voice, the production is absolutely unmatched ! ari really ATE & left NO crumbs with this beautiful & special & healing body of work / masterpiece. Her whole discography is the reason why i‚Äôm alive & this whole new album is absolutely so beautiful, so well done  , so powerful, so emotional, so special, so deep, so heartbreaking, so raw & so authentic. i‚Äôm so so so so incredibly proud & impressive with Ariana‚Äôs ability, her versatility, her art & her visuals. These songs / These lyrics really made me cry. This woman is definitely the MOST strongest & bravest woman alive. I love you so very much Ariana.

"This is one of the most beautifully melancholic songs I have ever heard.

"I initially thought this was about a romantic relationship. Looking into the lyrics, I think this is about the relationship between Ariana & media/press/fans (possibly surrounding the rumours she wrecked a marriage). 'You cling to your paper & pens' = waiting to write an article. 'Wait until you like me again' = when the angle changes and she is revered again by the press.  'Me & my truth we sit in silence' = Not addressing the rumours. 'Know that you made me' = the press and fans made her the success she is. 'I'm not how you paint me' = how she is depicted in the media.",@ColinnOk,2024-10-21T22:20:48Z,5
"For some reason, I don‚Äôt relate to this song romantically. It‚Äôs almost as though I‚Äôm singing it out to my 17 year old self & asking her to forgive me for everything I put her through.
