"Tay’s fortnight is a profound exploration of temporal fragility, emotional inertia, and the haunting persistence of memory. It’s  an intimate narrative of heartbreak, a meditation on the nature of time, and an inquiry into the human capacity to endure unresolved emotional tension.❤",@ayebaleelijah2148,2024-11-20T12:32:17Z,73
Already heard this twice on the radio in my car while out on a late night drive.The second it was raining slowly and I cranked up the volume and wow! This track just blew me away and made me think of my past both happy and sad memories I slightly had tears my eyes.Nothing like a late night drive out in the rain hearing this track with great 80s vibes!,@michaelvaladez3012,2024-07-25T06:29:52Z,53

"I don't know why this song as a lead single polarized so many people and was deemed ""not as strong"". This is one of Taylor's most beautiful, mature songs and Post Malone harmonizes and fits in with it effortlessly. ""I love you, it's ruining my life"" is one of the most simplest yet heartbreaking lyrics I've ever heard. The sadness hits hard in this one with the rich melancholic vocal melodies. Post Malone's solo toward the end is beautiful.",@christianzimm7597,2024-07-18T07:30:27Z,31

"I just can't believe that it's been a year—TTPD has already been one year old! I remember going back home from school and listening to this song. I wasn't a Swiftie at that time; a Swiftie friend of mine showed me this song. I don't know what to say now. I'm just feeling somewhat emotional that time elapses so fast, and this masterpiece has already been a year old, while it feels like yesterday.",@leopardinmystery6886,2025-04-19T03:39:45Z,13

"Can't believe it's been a year. I can't get this song out of my head. It's like it's stuck on loop in my head. A tortured feeling I didn't even know how to express found its voice in this track. And that outro? I'm still not over it. Man, it didn't just end the song — it hit so deep, it carved out a whole space in my memory. Still gives me goosebumps every time...🤍",@endgame3113,2025-04-20T03:41:04Z,8

"OMG I JUST REALIZED THE SYMBOLISM OF THE PHONEBOOTH IN THE LAST SCENE. I read this theory that the Post with no tattoos represents Joe, the Scientist Post represents Matty and the Phonebooth one represents Travis. The Phonebooth represents the way Travis tried to ""call"" her (sorta) by making a friendship bracelet with his number on it. And the way she was sitting on the Phonebooth when he was calling her, it's like she was at her worst but didn't realise that the one who will save her is right beside her, ""calling"" her.",@bhaktiagarwal5859,2024-12-03T16:11:32Z,2

She has a huge fan following especially among young women bcoz she tell their story or relates to them about their struggles and emotions in both love, relationship, lifestyles, this materialistic world.

I simply cannot not stop listening to this song and I can’t stop watching this Video. I am definitely A matured Taylor Swift Fan now.

Taylor Swift’s music is the worst thing to happen to humanity… because it ruined every other artist for me ;-; nobody compares.,@JustaStrangerLikeYou,2024-12-01T08:37:41Z,0
I love how Taylor contrasts the two characters: the girl who’s “cheer captain” and wears high heels versus the narrator who wears sneakers and listens to music in her room. It’s such a simple but powerful way of showing the difference between being seen and being overlooked.,@ErinDonnelly-x1u,2025-07-25T20:35:12Z,0

The passion in billie is such a moment.  Her voice really moves you.  She sings like if it's not a struggle to hit notes. A breeze,@natalievalenzuela7493,2024-12-12T14:47:48Z,0
