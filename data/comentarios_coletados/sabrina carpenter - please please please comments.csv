"When Sabrina said ""I heard you're an actor, so act like a stand up guy"" every woman alive felt that. The way her lyrics are so simple yet always have a double meaning is genius. Definitely one to watch.",@leahcollins1245,2024-09-20T09:48:56Z,1176
"This song is pure perfection from start to finish. From the very first note, it grabs my attention and doesn’t let go. Even after listening to it several times, it still feels as fresh and exciting as the first time. The melody, lyrics, and emotions blend perfectly, making it truly unforgettable.",@AI_Studio_7,2024-10-07T13:15:22Z,442

This is the first song I've listened to on REPEAT in years. The lyrics (hilarious!) and the sweet key changes... can't get enough!,@DarrinCarlson,2024-11-20T18:58:05Z,25
"I am def not the target demo for Sabrina Carpenter as a middle aged woman that primarily listens to electronica. This song is really good. The lyrics nail a very specific feeling that can happen in toxic relationships. I'll speak for myself here:  In a past toxic relationship,  was able to look away from lots of things to an extent. I could compartmentalize the bruising of my ego and heartbreak from the public embarrassment and blow to my reputation that comes with a partners bad behavior. I can't recall another song that has hit that real specific feeling. The lyrics are cleverly crafted and elevated with the bits of twang that come through. I had never heard this song outside of background music until her tiny desk show. That performance really highlighted the Country aspects of the songs she was playing, and what turned me onto this song specifically. She reminds me a little bit of Dolly in the best way possible. And now that I'm hearing this version of the song it's like a synthed out Dolly which is really cool. I never would've thought that kind of combination would work. Her harmonies are luscious too. This song has been burned into my brain for the last 72 hours. It scratches the right itches.",@kassandrakid9440,2024-12-27T08:14:52Z,25
Bro her voice is like magic. Bonnie hit the 80s/90s party vibe and Sabrina hits that and more. Absolutely digging the Pulp Fiction setup too. It’s going over a lot of heads though,@DreadPirateRoberts33,2025-06-19T13:45:01Z,22

"Am i the only one who only stares at the vid and starts thinking how sad it is to be this girl? Imagine it's not all fun n games where I mean IRL, there are ppl like this out there. Too egoistic to admit tht they've made a bad judgement. Too ego to admit n too scared of being told ""i told u so"" at their face. Bcs of the ego and embarrassment, they let themselves suffer in the long run, stay in a toxic relationship. I get it MV wont make the song look deep but this situation is actually depressing.

"To everyone saying this is a cute relationship, the man in the video abandoned his infant and postpartum wife to be with Sabrina. This is the Ariana Grande situation again but its mostly ignored because the couple in question is attractive. This deadbeat father is shooting music videos and following this young woman around on tour while the woman he imoregnated had to birth and raise a baby alone. Its not cute. Its evil and exploitative on his part. Sabrina deserves better too",@mrssoup1119,2024-10-24T00:12:34Z,3

"I'm typically a pop fan tbh and I like Sabrina's voice, but this song is incredibly irritating. I think being embarrassed of your partner has gotta be one of the biggest red flags imo. And listenting to this song makes me actively cringe because it just reminds me of incredibly toxic people who only use others as a way to prop themselves up. ""If you don't fit into the friend group, you're embarrassing and I'd rather you stay in"", mean girl ass behavior. And the tone just makes it seem like she couldn't give a shit less what would make him happy or what she likes about him as a person, it's just ""well you're my bf now so don't embarrass me"", mc syndrome. This song just makes me think she doesnt want a bf, but a pawn she can just move around her life to show off to others. Like, I genuinely can't imagine a guy making a so called ""love song"" about a girl and the entire song being about how he just doesnt want her to act like herself around his friends because it'll be bad for his image and ego. People would be calling it misogynistic.",@bluntbangs,2024-12-11T22:28:46Z,1

Man she's a mini TS with how long she stays with boys. At least she has vocals that I can appreciate. Not that she doesn't lip sync most songs at her concerts LOL,@Leighmarie92,2024-09-28T23:16:08Z,0

"Such an original idea. The music, the lyrics, the video, the look, the character, the story!! What a master piece.. I have never seen anything like this.. Not even a century!! This icon must be preserved at all cost, Sabrina the queen must live!! everyone must pass it to their grand grand grand children, that's the most precious heritage in humanity, the first and the last thing to show every alien higher dimensional civilization.. Our brightest glory hope of light.",@chewfuling,2024-09-27T22:41:19Z,0

This song is very annoying,@groovyfoo-h6n,2024-09-21T06:39:10Z,0
Nowadays inorder to be a singer you need autotune and a hot sexy body to cater male gaze... Music has succumbed to gaze,@mdas1156,2024-09-20T23:03:30Z,0

"It’s been a while since I stopped studying songs, I just listen but I don’t absorb. But, your TikTok video with no auto-tune, no backup vocals, no other effects gurl it hits me!!! It’s beauty and pure talent. And now, I’m memorizing every line! I’m starting to love you just today Sabrina! 💃🥰🥹",@chinyuna,2024-09-18T10:56:45Z,0
