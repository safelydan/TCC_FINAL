"By the time we were old enough it was too late. Hope this life goes well for you. Goodbye, the one. You will be forever thought of and missed for what could've been. Not just for myself but many men who have seen the women they love disappear into a place we dont know them anymore. Goodluck sweethearts. We love you more than you'll ever care to notice. We want the best for you even if it's not us. This is what makes us sucker's. Too good to care when we are getting screwed.... even if we are doing it to ourselves. We are only men. Dont blame all of us for the failures you've seen other men fail through. If we want you. You will know. Just do not take it personal if we find what we want but aren't ready to be married. We love you, just dont know how we can afford everything yet. We want so much for you. Please give us men a chance to show you what we want for you. We arent perfect but no one is. Enjoy love... like without isn't the same. Trust. Love. Indulge. Laugh. Cry. Fight. Be healthy and enjoy your life to the best extent. Which sadly is perishing at the same time. Its up to you. Deep down you know. Gotta stop listening to the bullshit in your mind. Be the man you want to be. PRACTICE NOW!!!

I'm the same, in the same room, doing my same boring routine inside those four walls. i feel caged inside my own house. i should be in university right now, i should be having a job right now, i should be a responsible adult right now, i should be taking care of my mom and dad, i should be productive...but I'm not. I'm not doing anything. I'm not in a university, I don't have a job, I'm not responsible, I'm a burden to my mom and dad and I'm going through this terrible situation, scenario and emotions every single day yet nothing changing. my prayers are unheard.

To be fair, it's not I've been around much places with any options. I'm okay being single, I try to love myself. I do enough to keep safe, but sometimes when I see couples in the store, or online, or really anywhere I'll feel this sickening lovesick heartbreak that can't be described in a way that would make sense. It makes my heart ache, wondering where my guy walking with me down the sidewalk is, or the soft smile in the darkness. I try not to get jealous, it feels more closer to grief. Each year gets a little harder, the older I get, the worse I tend to feel. The deeper the pain gets. I hope I find him.",@byersxxkarate5177,2024-12-06T23:14:15Z,1

"The song is psychologically deep. I feel like I'm falling down to the bottom of the ocean when I listen. Along the way down, the fish that are swimming nearby are calling out to me and singing the song. Eilish really has a unique sound to her voice and her whispering quality makes me want to listen further. Or at least, listen more closely than I would for other songs. I read some context about the song, and I suppose there are some fan theories about how she is referring to both an ex-boyfriend and another ex-girlfriend of her ex-boyfriend. It seems to be a song where she is comforting the ex-girlfriend, but then also speaking directly to the ex-boyfriend about her own experiences having dated him. That really is a rich and provocative love triangle, especially how now some people think that she is friends with the ex-girlfriend. I'd give this song over all the very solid rating. I'm just not necessarily a big fan of Eilish's whispering and lulling me to sleep tonality. The song has a really rich meaning that I appreciate.",@Purple_Cat_97,2024-12-19T15:56:05Z,0

This part makes me thinking and inspiring. Idk how to express my emotions but this is really good. She is super cool but she really doesn‚Äôt know or not enough to be good for her. Billie wish I could meet you one day. You don‚Äôt know how lovely you are. You think is not enough maybe but you are already cross the finish line. You are too far away and you can even see anything. Anyway you are good too be true ( for me at least) I truly love u no matter what you said or gonna say.

I'm going to be honest - I used to not like Billie Eilish as a kid but now that I'm a teenager I understand her music more and it speaks to me in such unexplainable ways.Her music is melancholic and sad - but I like that about her - she expresses all the emotions and feelings through her writing without caring if it's too sad or depressing to some people.And that is true art and true talent in my opinion - the expression of true emotions without fear or judgement.Just being sad and understanding that sadness is sometimes better than happiness.Sadness teaches us so many things happiness can't.And many famous people have gone through so much trauma only to come back stronger.I finally understand Billie and her music and I'm really grateful that her songs are sincere and truthful without faking happiness or optimism - just pure melancholy and grief that is slowly teaching us some lessons.,@zoranmiskic9406,2024-12-25T21:46:51Z,0
