Genuinely thought this was an old song I'd somehow missed. She really caught the old vibe so well!,@gokuxsephiroth4505,2024-12-09T23:50:54Z,1162
This might be one of the best industrial-synth-pop EDM tracks she's ever done.... She's clearly in her prime as a vocalist. This track shows a level of maturity as an artist... Very catchy.,@WahkeenaSitka,2024-10-25T20:14:07Z,573
"I love how she glides through different styles and still kills it every time, from Harlequin's jazz vibes to a full-on POP banger... LADY GAGA, YOU'RE A GENIUS!",@poczdarva,2024-10-26T20:35:37Z,224
The vocal layering is 🔥🔥🔥,@kevvvex,2024-10-25T22:25:32Z,98
I love how amazing this is. Her vocals are fire and how she slowly builds the song to explosion in the end.,@ofjdaz,2024-10-28T03:00:43Z,93
"Last album for a long time just for her true fans who loves her dark vibes. She doesn't need to top charts, win awards or earn millions. She did all of this in past. Now, she is free.",@rogerkallo6483,2024-10-28T16:53:41Z,88
There is so much originality to this song in every possible way from the beat to the tone to what Gaga does with her voice.  And the lyrics have so much force.  A perfect score on this one.,@tonymechcatie2792,2024-10-28T17:18:05Z,71
This song is unbelievably catchy. I learned every word already.,@FanOfVacuums2,2024-10-27T03:11:25Z,70

I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU WENT FOR AN OLD STYLE OLD SYNTH .,@BVBGAGAA,2024-10-26T09:19:44Z,43
I can't stop listening to it! The vocal lines she creates amplify the powerful feeling of this song. Lady Gaga isn’t just a singer; she’s a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. No one else can move from jazz to this genre with such results. I really wish I could sing like her!!! I just hope I don’t ruin this song when I make my cover...,@veronicashovel7099,2024-10-26T16:34:05Z,39
"This song instantly gives me that late 2000s and early 2010s vibe especially during the chorus where gaga says ""oh oh oh oh oh"" that part was fucking gorgeous",@Gyyghhhhjjjkk,2025-02-24T17:17:32Z,32
This song is a lot more harmonically sophisticated than it seems at first.  The modal shifts and dissonant chords really get under your skin... in the best possible way.,@MaximusNYC,2024-10-28T00:28:06Z,17
"This is thrilling. Everything we could have wanted from her new era - it feels like all previous eras of Gaga are present on this record - we hear the virtuoso pianist, the rock star, the pop star, the jazz vocalist taking risks, the dark synth queen … and a totally unique artistic voice - one that can look at the whole of humanity good and bad and deliver something of beauty - with depth and emotional range and yet the same time - also still, to put simply - a catchy hook laden pop song! No one can touch her! Thrilling!",@st3vi3,2024-10-26T19:53:42Z,15
A true masterpiece of art and creativity.  The vocals are impeccable. The passion of music is life. Thank you Gaga for your time and works.,@geraldburns2328,2025-03-23T01:45:16Z,11
