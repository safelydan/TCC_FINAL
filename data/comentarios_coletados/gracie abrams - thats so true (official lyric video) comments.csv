"Now i realised this isn't about Heartbreak or Relationships or Emotional/Psychological Death the speaker is experiencing due to betrayal, Nah. The Death reference everywhere and her struggle with OCD like me during COVID-19  Pandemic coupled with the inspiration for this song coming from her journaling which mirror my own OCD and dark thoughts during journaling makes me realize MUSIC and ART are  universal and can impact others. It touches countless souls without explicitly needing some words to be said. How layered and deep she gets touching the depths of ocean literally here coz she's talking about real death eerily enough. Don't you know the vibe?
