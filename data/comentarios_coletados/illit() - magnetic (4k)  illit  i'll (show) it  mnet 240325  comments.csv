"I've been into kpop since I was a preteen in the early 2000s but I haven't been this excited for a new gg. This group hits all the marks. I love the dreamy whimsical electropop sound, the mellow pop melody is nostalgic with what I've heard growing up, and the aesthetics has that Asian art house film coming of age/Fruits mag vibe ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Very excited for what's to come!",@sarahl9398,2024-03-26T00:07:40Z,4
"The more i see wonhee, she reminds me of the actress park han byul 박한별. Minju reminds me of shinee minho 민호. Yunha reminds me of tara hyomin 효민. Moka is like the smiley version of the actress jung somin (imay need to revisit this 1). iRoha has similar faces of many but it's hard to pick just one. To me, her eyes and mostly vibe reminds me of lisa bonet when she played the charcter denise. The girls, ILLIT are incredibly talented. This song is so catchy 😀",@winterso8589,2024-04-29T03:17:01Z,4

"And those are what  15?!? trying to attract the attention of middle school teens to say how good they are😅, but in fact like all idols from this company, they need singing lessons asap, take it easy with autotune and lipsynch.😊",@SleepyHarmonica-jt5yr,2024-03-25T19:55:27Z,3
"I knew that the pre-chorus reminded me of the running man dance song phrase vocal tuning and, by the time I saw them dancing at the final chorus, it all went linked. Great song btw",@rafaeltglz,2024-03-26T18:17:48Z,3
I Like how they all gave such a bright and positive vibes! I hope ILLIT for the best in the further🥰❤️,@Blumicrophyll,2024-03-28T06:11:03Z,3
They’re genuinely so cute and the song is so catchyyyy,@ECzerniecki,2024-03-26T16:35:31Z,3
The vocal idk this gen of kpop are all about lip syncing and dancing and more sound effects rather than singing. Anyone can be an idol nowadays as long as they have the face.. I miss SNSD and 2ne1. Tbh Newjeans actually have better vocal than them.,@MsLacieable,2024-03-26T08:34:51Z,3

"I really hope this group sings live, without autotune. I went to see NewJeans and Lesserafim, total disappointment, the supporting voices are heard more than their real voices, get in the front row, take off that they are pretty and that you have some ballet flats, I'm sorry but I spent my money in vain and if it's annoying. Hybe boy groups, on the other hand, do sing live and those who have been to Bts concerts and more can attest to this. Hybe will one day form a singing girl group. I hope so. For now I will only support BTS. Until there actually is a group of girls on Hybe who are singers, not just pretty faces.",@nobudaiki,2024-03-26T02:58:08Z,2

"UGH Love the concept, styling, and vibe. They are able to play on the magical/etheral vibes that the only Hybe GG's don't have. Very reminiscent of TXT IMO.would love them to see them do a similar concept to Enhypen since they are their sister group. Regarding the NJ similarities, like another Redditter has said before, ILLIT focuses on the more hyperpop and anime like sound while NJ only used this sound like once or twice. IMO it this song has ""Get up"" vibes but that's it. I think it just sucks that HYBE released another 5 member group (even though it was 6, but easily could've done 7) and only had 6 considering the amount of talent we saw in RUNext. I cant wait to see more releases from and I hope they can stick with this sound - kinda like the aim high and scrum vibes :)",@KPOPTrashLyrics,2024-03-25T20:46:52Z,0
