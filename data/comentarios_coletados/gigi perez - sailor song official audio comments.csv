"There's an emotion in this that I found in myself that I didn't know I have. A yearning, it's beautiful. I think I know myself better after this song.",@unclekaggy,2024-07-26T04:09:24Z,2130
As a writer (and a human) this song is so incredibly inspirational and emotional and makes me wanna run down a row of staircases and across intersections and scream it from the top of my lungs <3 thank you,@akiko575,2024-07-26T10:17:37Z,887

"""I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long.""

"I am 62, gay and male. I first heard this on some Tik Tok videos so I had to look it up (that line ""I don't believe in God but I believe that your my savior"" really stuck in my brain!) I know tons of people have heard this and thought it was a guy singing it! (Got to admit so did I!). Then when I finally heard the WHOLE SONG I was blown away! WOW! And that is was by a woman? MORE WOW!! The manufactured music of today is nothing I can really enjoy (for me, give me 60s-90s music and some post 2000 stuff, but that techno-synth-rap crap that it mostly out now is all the same) so when I hear what I consider a ""clean"" sound like this one, I can really enjoy it. And these are some of the BEST lyrics I have heard in a while! (like ""We can run away to the walls inside your house"" is very slick as well as ""When you get a taste can you tell me what's my flavor? VERY SLICK!!) She talks about sex without hitting you over the head with it! I love that! And I love that it is woman-woman song!! Go GIGI!!",@johngreener9784,2024-10-19T19:37:01Z,117

"Istg, this song wrecks me in the worst and best possible ways at the same time. I'm so in love with this guy that it hurts physically, and to know i will never, never be with him is basically slaughter on my last two finctioning braincells. I just want to be lovable, and the more time passes the more i see that i might never be lovable. I just wanted to be able to love someone freely, i want to be able to tell him i love him 50 times a day, and hug him, and comfort him and tell him that he's not stupid, or short, or ugly, he lools like an angel in my eyes. It hurts that i cannot show him this love. And it hurts that i will never be loved that way i love others!!",@mihaelaandries3451,2024-09-13T13:24:03Z,3

"I liked this girl since the day she transferred to my school,her laugh,her voice,her smile...everything about her is just so perfect.I always stare at her all the time she's just so gorgeous I can't help it,i wish i could tell her my feelings but we have never talked before and i know she likes boys.And it feels so right yet so wrong because my family is Muslim,I'm an atheist and I don't think they would ever accept me,even though I don't believe in god I'm still scared because it's a sin and it also makes me feel bad to like girls as a girl.I tried really hard to like boys but she's just so kind and perfect,this song reminds me of her.I already know we will never be together and she won't ever like me back but I'll still love her.Maybe we could've been in another universe,but why not in this one?",@cagla3067,2024-10-19T22:03:48Z,3
I found this song from yt shorts ( ofc. 😩) but when I looked this song up at first I was hesitant but now it’s my favorite song it gives me a mixed emotion of sadness and joy it makes me think of my bf but then also happiness and freedom while also realizing I can’t truly be free and have privacy due to my strict parents and then it gives me like- anixety of never having freedom? But then also when I’m an adult I will have to pay bills and be alone idk it’s just an amazing song,@Wcue_edits_,2024-10-15T04:36:52Z,3

Então eu decidi terminar, mas eu não queria, eu a amava e a amo, e toda vez que eu escuto essa música eu me lembro de todos os nossos momentos que estávamos felizes, eu te amo Anna Clara, e sempre vou te amar.",@novajerusalemvidros1811,2025-02-07T22:05:55Z,2

I just ""try"" to make people believe that I'm fine, but I'm not, it's just a mask hiding everything I'm feeling, I'm just standing, but I believe it will get better, if not I would have already ""ended it all"" if you know what I mean, but anyway, I just hope everything gets better, I still have a little hope that it will happen, thank you very much if you've read this far, it's just a personal rant.

Again, just me...but I see more images that tells the story of the song when sped up. Even your vocals feel like they are more in the pocket with a cent lead, instead of draggin 3 cents behind. I'll listen and have listened a few times at 1.15, I would and will not at normal. Crazy...Keep rockin though and doing your thang...",@iansmith3261,2025-01-17T00:52:20Z,1

I'm a 24 yo dude. I've heard this chorus alot in videos. I've hesitated to look the full song up until now because I knew it'd make me cry. Sure enough. But it's odd my tears fall out at small things like this but in real time it's like i freel like it takes longer for your emotions to register.  I've found love alot in my young life but I always took it for granted up until recent years where i have had no one. We shouldn't be okay with breaking people's hearts just because we felt that way once upon a time too. We need to be out here being heroes giving & expecting nothing in return,@zacharycatastrophee1859,2025-02-21T11:20:50Z,1

"Reminds me of when my best friend passed away earlier this year. He loved sea shanties, worked on the historic USS Constellation, and in general loves the culture of being a sailor in the Golden Age of Piracy. The lyrics , despite the reference to Anne Hathaway (unless there was a woman with that name who was alive back then, it's possible) sound like they were plucked straight from the 18th century with a very modern take on the arrangement and generally the ability to tell both a hetero and lesbian love story depending on the listener's imagination make this song such an amazing modern sea shanty. It should be blowing up everywhere. I wish he could have lived long enough to give this a listen.",@justinyoung109,2025-05-30T00:10:12Z,0

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor? And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor? I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong I sleep so I can see you, 'cause I hate to wait so long I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long She took my fingers to her mouth The kind of thing that makes you proud That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out And lately, I've tried other things But nothing can capture the sting Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?

"When I first heard this song, I just fell in love with it and It automatically made me remember of my special person, but everything just changed between us now.. it made me miss our little late night talks, when I used to stay up late to wait for their texts, our sweet conversations, when I used to stay up to wait for their texts, their company, all the moments when we used to laughed sm together.. the smiles I get just from one text from them, and the way they made you feel loved.. it feels like a bittersweet ending in a story when you both didn’t end up happily yet even in both of your separate ways.. there’s beautiful memories in those days you both had together,  despite the fights, misunderstandings, chaos that happened and you’d wish you can bring back those days back when everything was okay between you two, but you’re starting to slowly accept it now that it has to happen.. cause if it’s meant to be, then it will be, but you’re finally letting go and closing that chapter after holding on it for so long cause you can’t accept it still.. and it’s something that made you stronger and better person from those experiences. I just wanna write how this song makes me feel cause it’s more than just a feeling that I can’t describe, it feels so much to what I’m experiencing rn like memories flooding in remembering those happy moments you had with someone and even though you’re finally accepting the way things turned out, they will forever be special to you and you will forever treasure those moments and somewhere deep in your heart and glimpse of hope that maybe.. maybe one day.. ya’ll will meet one more time and you will be happy together again..",@zvlle,2024-12-03T03:29:14Z,0
