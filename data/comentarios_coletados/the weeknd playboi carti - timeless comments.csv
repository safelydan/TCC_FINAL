Even through he is finished making music under the weeknd name. I hope he continues to produce beats.,@Simplayified,2025-05-29T00:22:34Z,24
The drop in octaves with the synths at 1:25 is just insane and then again at 1:35 when he says rock but cuts the synth at that mark is just so good and intentional. So much work went into just the beat itself.,@brianreubelt,2025-05-01T00:21:45Z,23

When you watch the official video and listen to the lyrics specially when is telling us if I were you I would’ve cut my wrist is just a way of manipulating the mind to do that.. I mean not all are that weak to do that but if you watch the video is leading to the negative and dark.. be wise.. I loved the song too until I watched the video and saw the horns and all the signals..the music frequency is also manipulating us we have to be wise💯🔥🔥🔥🔥,@blazenbootyflowchannel8984,2025-03-28T09:14:56Z,0
