-1,0,So DO not think that I have lost my mind.. and that I am going crazy.. But I do remember.. few says ago.. I put a Heart.. I have the picture here with me still.. I do remember waking up this Morning.. I turn to look across from laying on the bed.. I see the Glass Jar.. But.. I felt like something is Missing.. something is gone.. maybe my eyes are just messing with me these days.. as YOU grow older.. things will change but.. I know for sure.. it was YOUR HEART inside.. I remember holding this Glass jar.. I was weeping and jumping UP and down with Joy.. Holding this Glass jar with Your Heart.. because the Heart belongs to YOU.. NO ONE ELSE comes close with the Joy YOU give.. the chills I feel in my hands.. when I look at Your Picture and knowing that YOUR HEART was with me this Close.. I would be holding this Same Glass Jar.. JUMPING up and down.. it is Your Heart.. Only IF.. you can see the reaction I felt.. just holding this Glass jar.. with YOUR HEART.. my both eyes would be closed.. two lines of tears running down with JOY and HOPE.. just to have YOU close means it is YOUR HEART I want to love.. waking UP this morning.. My Heart felt heavy.. HOW did I lose.. Is it because of Me.. I must be the one to Blame because I have lost Your Heart.. How can I ask YOU for Your Heart if it is ME who has lost the Heart.. BUT I WANT.. I WANT IT.. I need.. I can't breathe without YOU and it is only when I have your Heart so Close.. When I was holding the Glass Jar.. with YOUR HEART inside.. I can feel my Heart beating against.. Knocking from the Inside because MY MIND would go crazy.. I would go Nuts having this Heart of you close to My Chest that It wakes UP MY HEART to keep on knocking.. I was laying down.. waking UP.. seeing that There was NO Heart inside this Glass Jar.. I started to stumble on the ground.. started to walk around.. room to room.. kitchen to rest room.. Looking everywhere for the Heart.. I know that YOUR HEART just did not run.. did it run from Me.. is your Heart afraid of Me.. I would kiss the Glass Jar looking at your Picture.. Looking at Your Heart.. maybe Your Heart got scared of me kissing Your Heart too much.. of course I could not touch YOUR HEART.. But I wanted to touch and hold YOUR HEART.. I really wanted to kiss into your Heart and would say.. this is HOW MY HEART feels when YOUR HEART is close to me.. close to My Heart.. it makes me want to bring YOU CLOSER to me.. and I want to hold YOU.. but I could Not find the Heart.. I went all around the House looking for your Heart.. and I am looking at Your Picture.. What am I suppose to say.. I have lost Your Heart.. I just can't tell you that.. How can I say that.. so I was thinking putting my Heart inside to act like it is YOUR HEART.. a Letter came to me asking me for Your Heart.. YOU have wrote me.. asking if I can give YOUR HEART back to you.. I am here confused.. I just have lost Your Heart.. YOUR HEART is NOT inside this Glass Jar.. it is Now Empty.. what do I do.. How am I suppose to come to YOU.. and show YOU that the Glass Jar.. I have lost Your Heart.. I don't know where YOU Heart went.. but I do know that I have the same glass jar YOU gave me.. I know this belongs to YOU.. but when I give YOU this Glass Jar.. I don't want to give it to YOU empty like this.. Because I have gotten Your Message.. YOU want Your Heart back.. I begin to wonder.. WHY are you asking for YOUR HEART back.. YOU told me that I can keep Your Heart forever.. YOU told me that I can Love Your Heart.. why all of a sudden change of Heart.. why are you changing what YOU gave.. I want to have Your Heart.. I want to keep Your Heart close to Me.. I want to enjoy having YOUR HEART.. even though I may Not touch It.. I can still Love your Heart.. just the presence of being Close.. it means everything to Me.. Now.. YOU are asking me.. at a time like this when I can't even find Your Heart.. I means.. I am holding this Glass Jar.. it is empty.. in the middle of the Night.. I am standing out here.. frustrated at this Point because I love YOU.. and I love Your Heart.. I want the Heart.. YOUR HEART to stay with me.. why did YOU send a message at the time I can't find Your Heart.. DID your Heart ran from me and somehow went to YOU.. I am sure your Heart was in this Glass Jar like yesterday.. I do remember.. like I said.. I was so Happy.. So full of tears and joy.. my arms wrap around the Glass Jar.. it had YOUR HEART.. and I would be jumping UP and down.. knowing this Heart.. YOUR HEART belongs to YOU.. and I be able to love and care.. and Tell Your Heart.. HOW much I wanted YOU SO CLOSE.. how is it possible to be so close with me and Now.. YOU are taking that Love and Joy away from me.. LOOK.. after the Message.. and I read it in front of YOUR HEART which was inside the Glass Jar.. that is when YOUR HEART ran from me.. it is after I received.. I open the letter and I was so Hurt.. so I read it very loud.. to make it clear.. YOU were going to take my Pride and Joy and Love from me.. so I would speak and I think YOUR HEART heard my words.. so Is it me.. I read from the Inside at first.. but it made me fill in rage because YOU wanted Your Heart back.. I can Love Your Heart more than YOU can hold that Heart.. I can tell Your Heart.. so that My Heart can breathe again.. can Beat again and I can also sing to Your Heart.. I may not have a GOOD voice to sing.. but I still can sing HOW MUCH I love YOU and the Joy YOU Bring when I am able to see Your Heart so Close and to able to Love YOU more and More.. why can't I just Love YOU.. if YOU leave Your Heart with me.. if Your Heart can stay.. I know I will love Your Heart completely.. I can make YOU Happy.. I can love you where YOU can be the most Beautiful Flower in the world.. WHEN I looked from the bed this morning.. and I searched the whole House and I did not find Your Heart.. I felt broken inside.. Like I begin to feel I am missing YOU.. that Joy broke down.. I have chased Your Heart away.. it is because YOU were asking me to give Your Heart back.. I would sit.. I pulled Out the Wine.. hard wine and I sat down.. LOOKING at the Picture.. and I would say.. How can YOU be like this to Me.. How can YOU take Your Heart away from Me.. it brought me the greatest JOY I never felt.. I open the top Lid.. and having the Shot Glass Next to Me.. I pour the bottle of Wine into the Shot Glass.. I grabbed the Shot Glass.. Open my Mouth and slam into my Mouth.. I would pour me two to three more Shots.. up to four on the Shot Glass.. and slammed the Hard wine into my Mouth.. and I would sit there.. could Not believe that YOU are asking for Your Heart.. YOU told me that I can Love your Heart forever.. YOU told me to take good care of your Heart and even gave me this Glass Jar.. I told YOU that I would.. I would make a promise to Love YOU.. to Love your Heart.. that means to love YOU... why are you doing this to Me.. putting sorrow.. putting pains.. making me suffer like this.. Missing YOU drives me crazy.. it hurts me because I need YOU close.. I need Your Heart.. Where are YOU.. Where is Your Heart.. I would pull the Trying to close Both of My eyes.. and eyes would Open again.. Both eyes would close once again.. but eyes keeps on opening.. I am laying Down.. thinking of You.. Keep on thinking How Beautiful you are.. I would sit UP from my Bed.. I am Holding the Glass Jar.. My arms around and My Head looks Down.. I am looking at your Heart.. Is this really YOUR HEART.. tell me that this Heart does not Belong to YOU.. because I am so In Love with Your Heart.. as Long as this Heart is Yours and YOU can tell me that It is YOUR OWN HEART.. I can Love YOU because I was made for a Time like this to Tell YOU.. to Tell this Heart.. I love YOU.. I am not sure if YOU truly want to hear these Words of Mine.. but..

Good dress and clothing is attractive and classy and Arianna still looks great but as the good witch now.  Let me add any wealthy health advocate does intermittent fasting and has very low body fat as Arianna reflects now.

Love always hurts, it leaves scars, unfortunately that's how man is and because of pride he loses a lot! most often it is easier for us to hurt than to say a good or encouraging word, because inside we all suffer!

I kinda wish I had more of that melody in the beginning, even as a background or to replace the second chorus at 1:45. I think this element could have kept it a bit more lighter and dance- vibe like, without losing the weight of the song. I have to listen few more times. I loved the beat too.
