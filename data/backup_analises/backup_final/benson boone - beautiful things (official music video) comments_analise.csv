I will forever miss him because he was the one who pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to sing along with his piano playing. Around 2-5 days before he passed, we played our favorite one for the last time. He couldn’t even play through the whole song because of the severity of this illness, but it really meant the world to me that he tried anyways.
