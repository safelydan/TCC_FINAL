Positive,"Not to maaajorly over-analyze, but that model expression is so unique to me. It gives the vibe that she's breaking the 4th wall, aware of the chaos around her, and still acting like she's currently posing for a magazine. It feels like she's still there as a full human person, like we're almost there, and she's not being just an idea or concept or character, she's human but still tapping into a boss part of herself. I think it's unique because most modelly expressions look detached and/or beyond their current situation and tend not to be grounded.
