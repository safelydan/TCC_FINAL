"There are songs whose meaning is better left unexplored. I thought this song was about a romantic story, but Sabrina's voice is so sweet. I don't know English, so I appreciate the sound of the guitars, the pauses of each chord, the rhythm, and the drums. However, the meaning of the lyrics was not what I imagined.",@jefersonwilliamemerim,2024-11-10T04:57:53Z,5

"Yooo the younger generation is probably not going to get this but the music video for this song is giving me ""Death Becomes Her"" vibes. (It's an older movie that has a similar theme of two women going after the same man and they keep sort of coming back to life and then at the end he winds up dead and they become sort of friends)",@Cupcakeruple,2024-11-13T18:25:24Z,4

"Emblematic of contemporary times — someone comes up with a passably decent song , albeit with questionable lyrics, and then produces a really horrible video for it.  Sure, the excuse will be that it’s done for laughs and is too comical to be taken seriously and no, it’s not serious, nor should it be taken that way, but if this is what constitutes lighthearted today. I’ll pass on it. Maybe Madonna from 1987 instead.",@graterdeddly9527,2025-01-12T14:31:01Z,2
I’ve listened to this song 10000000 times and I don’t understand why y’all are serving DEATH to each other y’all are slaying the vibes. BTW When you sing “yeah I’ve been known to share JENNA WHY THE HELL MURDER HER!?!!?!? jk jk I know why,@xxDddysllgrl13xx,2025-01-24T19:03:04Z,1

"Jenna, for the only scripted funeral that I’ve watched of your work, and having only two lines! “I don’t know how you put up with that.” “Very insecure.” It’s your non-vocals and pauses within the cameras still frame that captivates your audience. That tombstone shot spoke to me in a way. Figuratively speaking. Hypothetically? Perhaps that too. 🤷🏻 What are you doing right now right now? Other than four productions this 2024 final months of the year? 👀 what are you wearing? “Team” something shirt? You woman you. I’m totally not watching reruns of YOu nor am I going to rewatch Studio 666👀 I could keep on going but maybe I will watch compared to these delays of productions. Anyway…cheers. You’re probably laying around on your bed. Scrolling through these comments. Eventually…one day. You know? Kiss. 👻",@CarlosEnriqueAmaro,2024-11-20T23:17:58Z,1

"So I was thinking about this music video today and I have a theory sort of I don’t know if this is like obvious but my theory is that the boyfriend of the video is probably saying different stuff about Sabrina’s character and stuff to Jenna’s character to make them go after each other like that and maybe what happened to him in the video the two characters discussed and compared notes, and they found out he was playing both of them at the same time so yeah that’s just my thoughts",@dansnowstark1595,2024-12-12T22:50:48Z,1

I would not like to take part in that. I honestly do not like the thought of living in a sick disgusting world or in a world where I think people are sick and disgusting, but for some reason have some thoughts I can’t actually die, like physically maybe I can, but then some healing shocking mind erasing, technology and, or magic or whatever happens you know regrowth back to a baby change look genes nutrition whatever or just keep farming me, so they can nonce off and torture people and try to send us to hell.",@Leestevensmusic,2025-02-09T19:06:57Z,0

"Mmmm...the song explores the theme of jealousy and the lingering bond between ex-lovers... Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”). This lyric maybe could seem ""trivial"", but... it is very deep indeed 😊😊",@aliceaccorsi2782,2025-03-08T20:06:44Z,0

"So I was thinking about this music video today and I have a theory sort of I don’t know if this is like obvious but my theory is that the boyfriend of the video is probably saying different stuff about Sabrina’s character and stuff to Jenna’s character to make them go after each other like that and maybe what happened to him in the video the two characters discussed and compared notes, and they found out he was playing both of them at the same time so yeah that’s just my thoughts",@dansnowstark1595,2024-12-12T22:50:48Z,1

Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”).

"Mmmm...the song explores the theme of jealousy and the lingering bond between ex-lovers... Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”). This lyric maybe could seem ""trivial"", but... it is very deep indeed 😊😊",@aliceaccorsi2782,2025-03-08T20:06:44Z,0
