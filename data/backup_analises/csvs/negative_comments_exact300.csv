"Hot take: not every powerful, badass woman who doesn't need a man is lesbian. In fact, the idea that they're lovers totally takes away from the actual story. It makes so much more sense and makes both characters cooler if they come out of the mess realizing that NEITHER of them need validation from a romantic relationship, and they become good friends because of their similar views. The last few seconds with the playful banter really confirms this: they both found a friend in each other, and they were willing to forgive each other for the beef between them.

"Hot take: not every powerful, badass woman who doesn't need a man is lesbian. In fact, the idea that they're lovers totally takes away from the actual story. It makes so much more sense and makes both characters cooler if they come out of the mess realizing that NEITHER of them need validation from a romantic relationship, and they become good friends because of their similar views. The last few seconds with the playful banter really confirms this: they both found a friend in each other, and they were willing to forgive each other for the beef between them.

"This is incredibly messed up. At a time when the world is witnessing real images of dead babies and innocent civilians being shot, bombed, with objects piercing through their bodies in Israel on October 7 and then nonstop in Gaza, this video treats violence like it is entertainment. It is pathetic to use shock value and rage bait just for views. The world is suffering. We are on the brink of a possible war. Our humanity is disappearing and human lives are being devalued. How tone deaf can this music video be. This is not what people want to see. No wonder people say the entertainment industry is demonic.",@Hummingbird25,2025-05-07T00:17:29Z,0
