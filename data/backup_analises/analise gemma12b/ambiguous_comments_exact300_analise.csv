Negative,"Emblematic of contemporary times — someone comes up with a passably decent song , albeit with questionable lyrics, and then produces a really horrible video for it.  Sure, the excuse will be that it’s done for laughs and is too comical to be taken seriously and no, it’s not serious, nor should it be taken that way, but if this is what constitutes lighthearted today.

Positive,"Jenna, for the only scripted funeral that I’ve watched of your work, and having only two lines! “I don’t know how you put up with that.” “Very insecure.” It’s your non-vocals and pauses within the cameras still frame that captivates your audience. That tombstone shot spoke to me in a way. Figuratively speaking. Hypothetically? Perhaps that too. 🤷🏻 What are you doing right now right now? Other than four productions this 2024 final months of the year? 👀 what are you wearing? “Team” something shirt? You woman you. I’m totally not watching reruns of YOu nor am I going to rewatch Studio 666👀 I could keep on going but maybe I will watch compared to these delays of productions. Anyway…cheers.

Neutral,"So I was thinking about this music video today and I have a theory sort of I don’t know if this is like obvious but my theory is that the boyfriend of the video is probably saying different stuff about Sabrina’s character and stuff to Jenna’s character to make them go after each other like that and maybe what happened to him in the video the two characters discussed and compared notes, and they found out he was playing both of them at the same time so yeah that’s just my thoughts",The comment presents a theory about the music video's plot rather than expressing a positive or negative emotional response.

Negative,"Really.... Another Taylor and Olivia type of song.  I know it's music but if you reverse these types of lyric's and the dude was telling another dude that he's tasting him through his ex girl, you get my point.  If your relationship doesn't work out, please move forward.  The fact that you have to write a song about him and even sing about it shows that your still living in the past.

I would not like to take part in that. I honestly do not like the thought of living in a sick disgusting world or in a world where I think people are sick and disgusting, but for some reason have some thoughts I can’t actually die, like physically maybe I can, but then some healing shocking mind erasing, technology and, or magic or whatever happens you know regrowth back to a baby change look genes nutrition whatever or just keep farming me, so they can nonce off and torture people and try to send us to hell.","The comment expresses significant distress, paranoia, and negative views about the world, people, and potential harm."

He made sure I knew he was talking about the line. He didn’t mind the song though. Thinks it’s catchy as hell! I agree. Plot twist of this whole thing….. I’m a 34 year old, straight man who works physical labor. My brother is a 40 year old, straight man who is a US Army Combat Medic vet. 😆😂🤣 I have listened to this song a few times now. Damn Sabrina is fine as hell though.","Despite an initial humorous shock, the commenter ultimately expresses enjoyment of the song's catchiness and appreciation for the artist."
Positive,"Mmmm...the song explores the theme of jealousy and the lingering bond between ex-lovers... Sabrina is really addressing someone who has gotten back together with his ex, insinuating that, despite the new relationship, the author’s presence is still palpable. The line “You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you” expresses the idea that, even though the relationship is over, the author is still a part of his ex’s life... so much so that the new partner cannot help but feel his presence! It is also very strong the way Sabrina emphasizes how some of his ex’s habits and behaviors, such as jokes or affectionate gestures, were learned from him (I am referring to “He’s funny, now all his jokes hit different / Guess who he learned that from?”). This lyric maybe could seem ""trivial"", but... it is very deep indeed 😊😊","The comment demonstrates a deep appreciation for the song's lyrical depth and complexity, conveyed through enthusiastic and positive language and emojis."
