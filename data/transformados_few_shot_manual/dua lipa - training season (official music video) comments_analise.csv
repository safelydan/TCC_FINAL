0,0,"The autumn equinox painting, the yellow waltz preamble of the season trees, is an emotional psychological theatrical scenario of the composition of the colors displayed on the heavenly wall; the sincere gray is amalgam  with the light of afterglow, in the shades of all the perpetives of the firmament !!!  The vision of the mermaid took place on the blue stone of the sea, and under the great mouth of the moon, which sang in the tuning fork of the watery world of whales and dolphins; capturing the senses of sailors and fishermen; and waking up the deep sleep of the rocks in the infinity of oceanic thoughts!!!  A  pintura do equin√≥cio outonal, o pre√¢mbulo da valsa amarela das √°rvores da esta√ß√£o,  √© um cen√°rio teatral psicol√≥gico emocional da composi√ß√£o das cores exibidas na parede celestial;  o cinzento sincero se am√°lgama com a luz do arrebol, nos tons de todas as perpectivas do firmamento!!! A vis√£o da sereia aconteceu sobre a pedra azul do mar, e sob a grande boca da lua, que cantava no diapas√£o do mundo aqu√°tico das baleias e golfinhos; capturando os sentidos dos marinheiros e pescadores; e acordando o sono profundo dos rochedos no infinito dos pensamentos oceanicos!!!  La peinture de l'√©quinoxe d'automne, pr√©ambule de la valse jaune des arbres de saison, est un sc√©nario th√©√¢tral psychologique √©motionnel de la composition des couleurs affich√©es sur le mur c√©leste ; le gris sinc√®re s'amalgame avec la lumi√®re de la r√©manence, dans les nuances de tous les perp√©tifs du firmament !!! La vision de la sir√®ne a eu lieu sur la pierre bleue de la mer, et sous la grande bouche de la lune, qui chantait dans le diapason du monde aquatique des baleines et des dauphins ; capturer les sens des marins et des p√™cheurs ; et r√©veiller le sommeil profond des roches dans l'infinit√© des pens√©es oc√©aniques !!! La pintura del equinoccio de oto√±o, el vals amarillo pre√°mbulo de los √°rboles de temporada, es un escenario teatral psicol√≥gico emocional de la composici√≥n de los colores que se muestran en la pared celestial; ¬°¬°¬°El gris sincero es amalgama con la luz del resplandor, en las sombras de todas las perpetivas del firmamento !!! La visi√≥n de la sirena tuvo lugar sobre la piedra azul del mar, y bajo la gran boca de la luna, que cantaba en el diapas√≥n del mundo acu√°tico de las ballenas y los delfines; capturando los sentidos de marineros y pescadores; y despertando  el sue√±o profundo de las rocas en la infinidad de pensamientos oce√°nicos!!! Il dipinto dell'equinozio d'autunno, il preambolo del valzer giallo degli alberi della stagione, √® uno scenario teatrale psicologico emotivo della composizione dei colori esposti sulla parete celeste; il grigio sincero si amalgama con la luce degli ultimi bagliori, nelle sfumature di tutti i perpetui del firmamento!!! La visione della sirena ebbe luogo sulla pietra azzurra del mare, e sotto la grande bocca della luna, che cantava nel diapason del mondo acquatico delle balene e dei delfini; catturare i sensi di marinai e pescatori; e svegliarsi  il sonno profondo degli scogli nell'infinito dei pensieri oceanici!!! Das Herbst-Tagundnachtgleiche-Gem√§lde, die gelbe Walzer-Einleitung der Jahreszeitenb√§ume, ist ein emotional-psychologisches Theaterszenario der Komposition der Farben, die an der himmlischen Wand angezeigt werden; Das aufrichtige Grau verschmilzt mit dem Licht des Nachgl√ºhens, in den Schattierungen aller Perpetiven des Firmaments !!! Die Vision der Meerjungfrau fand auf dem blauen Stein des Meeres und unter dem gro√üen Mund des Mondes statt, der in der Stimmgabel der Wasserwelt der Wale und Delfine sang; Entf√ºhrung der Sinne von Seeleuten und Fischern;; Den tiefen Schlaf der Felsen erwachen lassen, in der Unendlichkeit ozeanischer Gedanken; am unendlichen Grund der Ozeane!!!
