Positive,"I’ve never been a fan of Beyoncé, but this song can easily get lost in your head, and you can’t shake it. Besides that, I do have to say this.  Experimenting with different genres can help, until you find your voice, all new singers that break out into the music scene do this.  But for Beyoncé who’s been doing R&B, pop and hip hop music for as long as she has to jump ship to country is a big leap. Her voice is a powerhouse in the other genres of music and that’s been her vibe for all of her musical life. It’s great she’s expanding her repertoire and trying her hand at Country, and  Country musicians welcomed her with open arms to the country music  family.  But with her vocals mixing with country music is an absolute long shot. I admit country music isn’t what it used to be, it’s a little more poppy, but there some artist’s that love to go back to the traditional ways of what country music use to be. But in the case of Miss Beyoncé, there are already Country Queens.

Hammer is more gangsta than 99.9% of ""Gangsta Rappers"". For real.)That's in the same genre! Art Official Age as the late, great, greatest of all time, Price put it. (If you don't know, look it up.)
